 146) "    Of unimproved mettle hot and full,  "
 147) "    Hath in the skirts of Norway, here and there,"
 148) "    Shark'd up a list of lawless resolutes,"

 157) "    Of this post-haste and romage in the land."
 158) "  Ber. I think it be no other but e'en so."
 159) "    Well may it sort that this portentous figure"
 160) "    Comes armed through our watch, so like the King"
 161) "    That was and is the question of these wars."
 162) "  Hor. A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye."
 163) "    In the most high and palmy state of Rome,"
 164) "    A little ere the mightiest Julius fell,"
 165) "    The graves stood tenantless, and the sheeted dead"
 166) "    Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets;  "
 167) "    As stars with trains of fire, and dews of blood,"
 168) "    Disasters in the sun; and the moist star"
 169) "    Upon whose influence Neptune's empire stands"
 170) "    Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse."
 171) "    And even the like precurse of fierce events,"
 172) "    As harbingers preceding still the fates"
 173) "    And prologue to the omen coming on,"
 174) "    Have heaven and earth together demonstrated"
 175) "    Unto our climature and countrymen."

 191) "                                                 The cock crows."
 192) "    Speak of it! Stay, and speak!- Stop it, Marcellus!"
 193) "  Mar. Shall I strike at it with my partisan?"
 194) "  Hor. Do, if it will not stand."
 195) "  Ber. 'Tis here!"
 196) "  Hor. 'Tis here!"
 197) "  Mar. 'Tis gone!"
 198) "                                                     Exit Ghost."

 203) "  Ber. It was about to speak, when the cock crew."
 204) "  Hor. And then it started, like a guilty thing  "
 205) "    Upon a fearful summons. I have heard"
 206) "    The cock, that is the trumpet to the morn,"
 207) "    Doth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat"
 208) "    Awake the god of day; and at his warning,"
 209) "    Whether in sea or fire, in earth or air,"
 210) "    Th' extravagant and erring spirit hies"

 222) "    But look, the morn, in russet mantle clad,"
 223) "    Walks o'er the dew of yon high eastward hill."
 224) "    Break we our watch up; and by my advice  "
 225) "    Let us impart what we have seen to-night"
 226) "    Unto young Hamlet; for, upon my life,"
 227) "    This spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him."
 228) "    Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it,"
 229) "    As needful in our loves, fitting our duty?"
 230) "    Let's do't, I pray; and I this morning know"

 238) "    The memory be green, and that it us befitted"
 239) "    To bear our hearts in grief, and our whole kingdom"
 240) "    To be contracted in one brow of woe,"
 241) "    Yet so far hath discretion fought with nature"
 242) "    That we with wisest sorrow think on him"
 243) "    Together with remembrance of ourselves."
 244) "    Therefore our sometime sister, now our queen,"
 245) "    Th' imperial jointress to this warlike state,"
 246) "    Have we, as 'twere with a defeated joy,"
 247) "    With an auspicious, and a dropping eye,"
 248) "    With mirth in funeral, and with dirge in marriage,"
 249) "    In equal scale weighing delight and dole,"
 250) "    Taken to wife; nor have we herein barr'd"
 251) "    Your better wisdoms, which have freely gone  "
 252) "    With this affair along. For all, our thanks."
 253) "    Now follows, that you know, young Fortinbras,"
 254) "    Holding a weak supposal of our worth,"
 255) "    Or thinking by our late dear brother's death"
 256) "    Our state to be disjoint and out of frame,"
 257) "    Colleagued with this dream of his advantage,"
 258) "    He hath not fail'd to pester us with message"
 259) "    Importing the surrender of those lands"
 260) "    Lost by his father, with all bands of law,"
 261) "    To our most valiant brother. So much for him."
 262) "    Now for ourself and for this time of meeting."
 263) "    Thus much the business is: we have here writ"
 264) "    To Norway, uncle of young Fortinbras,"
 265) "    Who, impotent and bedrid, scarcely hears"

 268) "    The lists, and full proportions are all made"
 269) "    Out of his subject; and we here dispatch"
 270) "    You, good Cornelius, and you, Voltemand,"
 271) "    For bearers of this greeting to old Norway,  "
 272) "    Giving to you no further personal power"
 273) "    To business with the King, more than the scope"

 279) "    And now, Laertes, what's the news with you?"
 280) "    You told us of some suit. What is't, Laertes?"
 281) "    You cannot speak of reason to the Dane"
 282) "    And lose your voice. What wouldst thou beg, Laertes,"
 283) "    That shall not be my offer, not thy asking?"
 284) "    The head is not more native to the heart,"
 285) "    The hand more instrumental to the mouth,"
 286) "    Than is the throne of Denmark to thy father."
 287) "    What wouldst thou have, Laertes?"
 288) "  Laer. My dread lord,"
 289) "    Your leave and favour to return to France;"
 290) "    From whence though willingly I came to Denmark"
 291) "    To show my duty in your coronation,  "
 292) "    Yet now I must confess, that duty done,"
 293) "    My thoughts and wishes bend again toward France"
 294) "    And bow them to your gracious leave and pardon."
 295) "  King. Have you your father's leave? What says Polonius?"
 296) "  Pol. He hath, my lord, wrung from me my slow leave"
 297) "    By laboursome petition, and at last"
 298) "    Upon his will I seal'd my hard consent."
 299) "    I do beseech you give him leave to go."
 300) "  King. Take thy fair hour, Laertes. Time be thine,"

 302) "    But now, my cousin Hamlet, and my son-"
 303) "  Ham. [aside] A little more than kin, and less than kind!"
 304) "  King. How is it that the clouds still hang on you?"
 305) "  Ham. Not so, my lord. I am too much i' th' sun."
 306) "  Queen. Good Hamlet, cast thy nighted colour off,"
 307) "    And let thine eye look like a friend on Denmark."
 308) "    Do not for ever with thy vailed lids"
 309) "    Seek for thy noble father in the dust."
 310) "    Thou know'st 'tis common. All that lives must die,"
 311) "    Passing through nature to eternity.  "
 312) "  Ham. Ay, madam, it is common."
 313) "  Queen. If it be,"
 314) "    Why seems it so particular with thee?"
 315) "  Ham. Seems, madam, Nay, it is. I know not 'seems.'"
 316) "    'Tis not alone my inky cloak, good mother,"
 317) "    Nor customary suits of solemn black,"
 318) "    Nor windy suspiration of forc'd breath,"
 319) "    No, nor the fruitful river in the eye,"
 320) "    Nor the dejected havior of the visage,"
 321) "    Together with all forms, moods, shapes of grief,"
 322) "    'That can denote me truly. These indeed seem,"
 323) "    For they are actions that a man might play;"
 324) "    But I have that within which passeth show-"
 325) "    These but the trappings and the suits of woe."
 326) "  King. 'Tis sweet and commendable in your nature, Hamlet,"
 327) "    To give these mourning duties to your father;"
 328) "    But you must know, your father lost a father;"
 329) "    That father lost, lost his, and the survivor bound"
 330) "    In filial obligation for some term"
 331) "    To do obsequious sorrow. But to persever  "
 332) "    In obstinate condolement is a course"
 333) "    Of impious stubbornness. 'Tis unmanly grief;"
 334) "    It shows a will most incorrect to heaven,"
 335) "    A heart unfortified, a mind impatient,"
 336) "    An understanding simple and unschool'd;"
 337) "    For what we know must be, and is as common"
 338) "    As any the most vulgar thing to sense,"
 339) "    Why should we in our peevish opposition"
 340) "    Take it to heart? Fie! 'tis a fault to heaven,"
 341) "    A fault against the dead, a fault to nature,"
 342) "    To reason most absurd, whose common theme"
 343) "    Is death of fathers, and who still hath cried,"
 344) "    From the first corse till he that died to-day,"
 345) "    'This must be so.' We pray you throw to earth"
 346) "    This unprevailing woe, and think of us"
 347) "    As of a father; for let the world take note"
 348) "    You are the most immediate to our throne,"
 349) "    And with no less nobility of love"
 350) "    Than that which dearest father bears his son"
 351) "    Do I impart toward you. For your intent  "
 352) "    In going back to school in Wittenberg,"
 353) "    It is most retrograde to our desire;"
 354) "    And we beseech you, bend you to remain"
 355) "    Here in the cheer and comfort of our eye,"
 356) "    Our chiefest courtier, cousin, and our son."
 357) "  Queen. Let not thy mother lose her prayers, Hamlet."
 358) "    I pray thee stay with us, go not to Wittenberg."
 359) "  Ham. I shall in all my best obey you, madam."
 360) "  King. Why, 'tis a loving and a fair reply."
 361) "    Be as ourself in Denmark. Madam, come."
 362) "    This gentle and unforc'd accord of Hamlet"
 363) "    Sits smiling to my heart; in grace whereof,"
 364) "    No jocund health that Denmark drinks to-day"
 365) "    But the great cannon to the clouds shall tell,"
 366) "    And the King's rouse the heaven shall bruit again,"
 367) "    Respeaking earthly thunder. Come away."
 368) "                                Flourish. Exeunt all but Hamlet."
 369) "  Ham. O that this too too solid flesh would melt,"
 370) "    Thaw, and resolve itself into a dew!"
 371) "    Or that the Everlasting had not fix'd  "
 372) "    His canon 'gainst self-slaughter! O God! God!"
 373) "    How weary, stale, flat, and unprofitable"
 374) "    Seem to me all the uses of this world!"
 375) "    Fie on't! ah, fie! 'Tis an unweeded garden"
 376) "    That grows to seed; things rank and gross in nature"
 377) "    Possess it merely. That it should come to this!"
 378) "    But two months dead! Nay, not so much, not two."
 379) "    So excellent a king, that was to this"
 380) "    Hyperion to a satyr; so loving to my mother"
 381) "    That he might not beteem the winds of heaven"
 382) "    Visit her face too roughly. Heaven and earth!"
 383) "    Must I remember? Why, she would hang on him"
 384) "    As if increase of appetite had grown"
 385) "    By what it fed on; and yet, within a month-"
 386) "    Let me not think on't! Frailty, thy name is woman!-"
 387) "    A little month, or ere those shoes were old"
 388) "    With which she followed my poor father's body"
 389) "    Like Niobe, all tears- why she, even she"
 390) "    (O God! a beast that wants discourse of reason"
 391) "    Would have mourn'd longer) married with my uncle;  "
 392) "    My father's brother, but no more like my father"
 393) "    Than I to Hercules. Within a month,"
 394) "    Ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears"
 395) "    Had left the flushing in her galled eyes,"
 396) "    She married. O, most wicked speed, to post"
 397) "    With such dexterity to incestuous sheets!"
 398) "    It is not, nor it cannot come to good."
 399) "    But break my heart, for I must hold my tongue!"
 400) "          Enter Horatio, Marcellus, and Bernardo."
 401) "  Hor. Hail to your lordship!"
 402) "  Ham. I am glad to see you well."
 403) "    Horatio!- or I do forget myself."
 404) "  Hor. The same, my lord, and your poor servant ever."
 405) "  Ham. Sir, my good friend- I'll change that name with you."
 406) "    And what make you from Wittenberg, Horatio?"
 407) "    Marcellus?"
 408) "  Mar. My good lord!"
 409) "  Ham. I am very glad to see you.- [To Bernardo] Good even, sir.-  "
 410) "    But what, in faith, make you from Wittenberg?"
 411) "  Hor. A truant disposition, good my lord."
 412) "  Ham. I would not hear your enemy say so,"
 413) "    Nor shall you do my ear that violence"
 414) "    To make it truster of your own report"
 415) "    Against yourself. I know you are no truant."
 416) "    But what is your affair in Elsinore?"
 417) "    We'll teach you to drink deep ere you depart."
 418) "  Hor. My lord, I came to see your father's funeral."
 419) "  Ham. I prithee do not mock me, fellow student."
 420) "    I think it was to see my mother's wedding."
 421) "  Hor. Indeed, my lord, it followed hard upon."
 422) "  Ham. Thrift, thrift, Horatio! The funeral bak'd meats"
 423) "    Did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables."
 424) "    Would I had met my dearest foe in heaven"
 425) "    Or ever I had seen that day, Horatio!"
 426) "    My father- methinks I see my father."
 427) "  Hor. O, where, my lord?"
 428) "  Ham. In my mind's eye, Horatio."
 429) "  Hor. I saw him once. He was a goodly king.  "
 430) "  Ham. He was a man, take him for all in all."
 431) "    I shall not look upon his like again."
 432) "  Hor. My lord, I think I saw him yesternight."
 433) "  Ham. Saw? who?"
 434) "  Hor. My lord, the King your father."
 435) "  Ham. The King my father?"
 436) "  Hor. Season your admiration for a while"
 437) "    With an attent ear, till I may deliver"
 438) "    Upon the witness of these gentlemen,"
 439) "    This marvel to you."
 440) "  Ham. For God's love let me hear!"
 441) "  Hor. Two nights together had these gentlemen"
 442) "    (Marcellus and Bernardo) on their watch"
 443) "    In the dead vast and middle of the night"
 444) "    Been thus encount'red. A figure like your father,"
 445) "    Armed at point exactly, cap-a-pe,"
 446) "    Appears before them and with solemn march"
 447) "    Goes slow and stately by them. Thrice he walk'd"
 448) "    By their oppress'd and fear-surprised eyes,"
 449) "    Within his truncheon's length; whilst they distill'd  "
 450) "    Almost to jelly with the act of fear,"
 451) "    Stand dumb and speak not to him. This to me"
 452) "    In dreadful secrecy impart they did,"
 453) "    And I with them the third night kept the watch;"
 454) "    Where, as they had deliver'd, both in time,"
 455) "    Form of the thing, each word made true and good,"
 456) "    The apparition comes. I knew your father."
 457) "    These hands are not more like."
 458) "  Ham. But where was this?"
 459) "  Mar. My lord, upon the platform where we watch'd."
 460) "  Ham. Did you not speak to it?"
 461) "  Hor. My lord, I did;"
 462) "    But answer made it none. Yet once methought"
 463) "    It lifted up it head and did address"
 464) "    Itself to motion, like as it would speak;"
 465) "    But even then the morning cock crew loud,"
 466) "    And at the sound it shrunk in haste away"
 467) "    And vanish'd from our sight."
 468) "  Ham. 'Tis very strange."
 469) "  Hor. As I do live, my honour'd lord, 'tis true;  "
 470) "    And we did think it writ down in our duty"
 471) "    To let you know of it."
 472) "  Ham. Indeed, indeed, sirs. But this troubles me."
 473) "    Hold you the watch to-night?"
 474) "  Both [Mar. and Ber.] We do, my lord."
 475) "  Ham. Arm'd, say you?"
 476) "  Both. Arm'd, my lord."
 477) "  Ham. From top to toe?"
 478) "  Both. My lord, from head to foot."
 479) "  Ham. Then saw you not his face?"
 480) "  Hor. O, yes, my lord! He wore his beaver up."
 481) "  Ham. What, look'd he frowningly."
 482) "  Hor. A countenance more in sorrow than in anger."
 483) "  Ham. Pale or red?"
 484) "  Hor. Nay, very pale."
 485) "  Ham. And fix'd his eyes upon you?"
 486) "  Hor. Most constantly."
 487) "  Ham. I would I had been there."
 488) "  Hor. It would have much amaz'd you."
 489) "  Ham. Very like, very like. Stay'd it long?  "
 490) "  Hor. While one with moderate haste might tell a hundred."
 491) "  Both. Longer, longer."
 492) "  Hor. Not when I saw't."
 493) "  Ham. His beard was grizzled- no?"
 494) "  Hor. It was, as I have seen it in his life,"
 495) "    A sable silver'd."
 496) "  Ham. I will watch to-night."
 497) "    Perchance 'twill walk again."
 498) "  Hor. I warr'nt it will."
 499) "  Ham. If it assume my noble father's person,"
 500) "    I'll speak to it, though hell itself should gape"
 501) "    And bid me hold my peace. I pray you all,"
 502) "    If you have hitherto conceal'd this sight,"
 503) "    Let it be tenable in your silence still;"
 504) "    And whatsoever else shall hap to-night,"
 505) "    Give it an understanding but no tongue."
 506) "    I will requite your loves. So, fare you well."
 507) "    Upon the platform, 'twixt eleven and twelve,"
 508) "    I'll visit you."
 509) "  All. Our duty to your honour.  "
 510) "  Ham. Your loves, as mine to you. Farewell."
 511) "                                        Exeunt [all but Hamlet]."
 512) "    My father's spirit- in arms? All is not well."
 513) "    I doubt some foul play. Would the night were come!"
 514) "    Till then sit still, my soul. Foul deeds will rise,"
 515) "    Though all the earth o'erwhelm them, to men's eyes."
 516) "Exit."
 517) "Scene III."
 518) "Elsinore. A room in the house of Polonius."
 519) "Enter Laertes and Ophelia."
 520) "  Laer. My necessaries are embark'd. Farewell."
 521) "    And, sister, as the winds give benefit"
 522) "    And convoy is assistant, do not sleep,"
 523) "    But let me hear from you."
 524) "  Oph. Do you doubt that?"
 525) "  Laer. For Hamlet, and the trifling of his favour,"
 526) "    Hold it a fashion, and a toy in blood;"
 527) "    A violet in the youth of primy nature,"
 528) "    Forward, not permanent- sweet, not lasting;"
 529) "    The perfume and suppliance of a minute;"
 530) "    No more."
 531) "  Oph. No more but so?"
 532) "  Laer. Think it no more."
 533) "    For nature crescent does not grow alone"
 534) "    In thews and bulk; but as this temple waxes,"
 535) "    The inward service of the mind and soul"
 536) "    Grows wide withal. Perhaps he loves you now,  "
 537) "    And now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch"
 538) "    The virtue of his will; but you must fear,"
 539) "    His greatness weigh'd, his will is not his own;"
 540) "    For he himself is subject to his birth."
 541) "    He may not, as unvalued persons do,"
 542) "    Carve for himself, for on his choice depends"
 543) "    The safety and health of this whole state,"
 544) "    And therefore must his choice be circumscrib'd"
 545) "    Unto the voice and yielding of that body"
 546) "    Whereof he is the head. Then if he says he loves you,"
 547) "    It fits your wisdom so far to believe it"
 548) "    As he in his particular act and place"
 549) "    May give his saying deed; which is no further"
 550) "    Than the main voice of Denmark goes withal."
 551) "    Then weigh what loss your honour may sustain"
 552) "    If with too credent ear you list his songs,"
 553) "    Or lose your heart, or your chaste treasure open"
 554) "    To his unmast'red importunity."
 555) "    Fear it, Ophelia, fear it, my dear sister,"
 556) "    And keep you in the rear of your affection,  "
 557) "    Out of the shot and danger of desire."
 558) "    The chariest maid is prodigal enough"
 559) "    If she unmask her beauty to the moon."
 560) "    Virtue itself scopes not calumnious strokes."
 561) "    The canker galls the infants of the spring"
 562) "    Too oft before their buttons be disclos'd,"
 563) "    And in the morn and liquid dew of youth"
 564) "    Contagious blastments are most imminent."
 565) "    Be wary then; best safety lies in fear."
 566) "    Youth to itself rebels, though none else near."
 567) "  Oph. I shall th' effect of this good lesson keep"
 568) "    As watchman to my heart. But, good my brother,"
 569) "    Do not as some ungracious pastors do,"
 570) "    Show me the steep and thorny way to heaven,"
 571) "    Whiles, like a puff'd and reckless libertine,"
 572) "    Himself the primrose path of dalliance treads"
 573) "    And recks not his own rede."
 574) "  Laer. O, fear me not!"
 575) "                       Enter Polonius.  "
 576) "    I stay too long. But here my father comes."
 577) "    A double blessing is a double grace;"
 578) "    Occasion smiles upon a second leave."
 579) "  Pol. Yet here, Laertes? Aboard, aboard, for shame!"
 580) "    The wind sits in the shoulder of your sail,"
 581) "    And you are stay'd for. There- my blessing with thee!"
 582) "    And these few precepts in thy memory"
 583) "    Look thou character. Give thy thoughts no tongue,"
 584) "    Nor any unproportion'd thought his act."
 585) "    Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar:"
 586) "    Those friends thou hast, and their adoption tried,"
 587) "    Grapple them unto thy soul with hoops of steel;"
 588) "    But do not dull thy palm with entertainment"
 589) "    Of each new-hatch'd, unfledg'd comrade. Beware"
 590) "    Of entrance to a quarrel; but being in,"
 591) "    Bear't that th' opposed may beware of thee."
 592) "    Give every man thine ear, but few thy voice;"
 593) "    Take each man's censure, but reserve thy judgment."
 594) "    Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy,  "
 595) "    But not express'd in fancy; rich, not gaudy;"
 596) "    For the apparel oft proclaims the man,"
 597) "    And they in France of the best rank and station"
 598) "    Are most select and generous, chief in that."
 599) "    Neither a borrower nor a lender be;"
 600) "    For loan oft loses both itself and friend,"
 601) "    And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry."
 602) "    This above all- to thine own self be true,"
 603) "    And it must follow, as the night the day,"
 604) "    Thou canst not then be false to any man."
 605) "    Farewell. My blessing season this in thee!"
 606) "  Laer. Most humbly do I take my leave, my lord."
 607) "  Pol. The time invites you. Go, your servants tend."
 608) "  Laer. Farewell, Ophelia, and remember well"
 609) "    What I have said to you."
 610) "  Oph. 'Tis in my memory lock'd,"
 611) "    And you yourself shall keep the key of it."
 612) "  Laer. Farewell.                                          Exit."
 613) "  Pol. What is't, Ophelia, he hath said to you?"
 614) "  Oph. So please you, something touching the Lord Hamlet.  "
 615) "  Pol. Marry, well bethought!"
 616) "    'Tis told me he hath very oft of late"
 617) "    Given private time to you, and you yourself"
 618) "    Have of your audience been most free and bounteous."
 619) "    If it be so- as so 'tis put on me,"
 620) "    And that in way of caution- I must tell you"
 621) "    You do not understand yourself so clearly"
 622) "    As it behooves my daughter and your honour."
 623) "    What is between you? Give me up the truth."
 624) "  Oph. He hath, my lord, of late made many tenders"
 625) "    Of his affection to me."
 626) "  Pol. Affection? Pooh! You speak like a green girl,"
 627) "    Unsifted in such perilous circumstance."
 628) "    Do you believe his tenders, as you call them?"
 629) "  Oph. I do not know, my lord, what I should think,"
 630) "  Pol. Marry, I will teach you! Think yourself a baby"
 631) "    That you have ta'en these tenders for true pay,"
 632) "    Which are not sterling. Tender yourself more dearly,"
 633) "    Or (not to crack the wind of the poor phrase,"
 634) "    Running it thus) you'll tender me a fool.  "
 635) "  Oph. My lord, he hath importun'd me with love"
 636) "    In honourable fashion."
 637) "  Pol. Ay, fashion you may call it. Go to, go to!"
 638) "  Oph. And hath given countenance to his speech, my lord,"
 639) "    With almost all the holy vows of heaven."
 640) "  Pol. Ay, springes to catch woodcocks! I do know,"
 641) "    When the blood burns, how prodigal the soul"
 642) "    Lends the tongue vows. These blazes, daughter,"
 643) "    Giving more light than heat, extinct in both"
 644) "    Even in their promise, as it is a-making,"
 645) "    You must not take for fire. From this time"
 646) "    Be something scanter of your maiden presence."
 647) "    Set your entreatments at a higher rate"
 648) "    Than a command to parley. For Lord Hamlet,"
 649) "    Believe so much in him, that he is young,"
 650) "    And with a larger tether may he walk"
 651) "    Than may be given you. In few, Ophelia,"
 652) "    Do not believe his vows; for they are brokers,"
 653) "    Not of that dye which their investments show,"
 654) "    But mere implorators of unholy suits,  "
 655) "    Breathing like sanctified and pious bawds,"
 656) "    The better to beguile. This is for all:"
 657) "    I would not, in plain terms, from this time forth"
 658) "    Have you so slander any moment leisure"
 659) "    As to give words or talk with the Lord Hamlet."
 660) "    Look to't, I charge you. Come your ways."
 661) "  Oph. I shall obey, my lord."
 662) "                                                         Exeunt."
 663) "Scene IV."
 664) "Elsinore. The platform before the Castle."
 665) "Enter Hamlet, Horatio, and Marcellus."
 666) "  Ham. The air bites shrewdly; it is very cold."
 667) "  Hor. It is a nipping and an eager air."
 668) "  Ham. What hour now?"
 669) "  Hor. I think it lacks of twelve."
 670) "  Mar. No, it is struck."
 671) "  Hor. Indeed? I heard it not. It then draws near the season"
 672) "    Wherein the spirit held his wont to walk."
 673) "                   A flourish of trumpets, and two pieces go off."
 674) "    What does this mean, my lord?"
 675) "  Ham. The King doth wake to-night and takes his rouse,"
 676) "    Keeps wassail, and the swagg'ring upspring reels,"
 677) "    And, as he drains his draughts of Rhenish down,"
 678) "    The kettledrum and trumpet thus bray out"
 679) "    The triumph of his pledge."
 680) "  Hor. Is it a custom?"
 681) "  Ham. Ay, marry, is't;"
 682) "    But to my mind, though I am native here  "
 683) "    And to the manner born, it is a custom"
 684) "    More honour'd in the breach than the observance."
 685) "    This heavy-headed revel east and west"
 686) "    Makes us traduc'd and tax'd of other nations;"
 687) "    They clip us drunkards and with swinish phrase"
 688) "    Soil our addition; and indeed it takes"
 689) "    From our achievements, though perform'd at height,"
 690) "    The pith and marrow of our attribute."
 691) "    So oft it chances in particular men"
 692) "    That, for some vicious mole of nature in them,"
 693) "    As in their birth,- wherein they are not guilty,"
 694) "    Since nature cannot choose his origin,-"
 695) "    By the o'ergrowth of some complexion,"
 696) "    Oft breaking down the pales and forts of reason,"
 697) "    Or by some habit that too much o'erleavens"
 698) "    The form of plausive manners, that these men"
 699) "    Carrying, I say, the stamp of one defect,"
 700) "    Being nature's livery, or fortune's star,"
 701) "    Their virtues else- be they as pure as grace,"
 702) "    As infinite as man may undergo-  "
 703) "    Shall in the general censure take corruption"
 704) "    From that particular fault. The dram of e'il"
 705) "    Doth all the noble substance often dout To his own scandal."
 706) "                         Enter Ghost."
 707) "  Hor. Look, my lord, it comes!"
 708) "  Ham. Angels and ministers of grace defend us!"
 709) "    Be thou a spirit of health or goblin damn'd,"
 710) "    Bring with thee airs from heaven or blasts from hell,"
 711) "    Be thy intents wicked or charitable,"
 712) "    Thou com'st in such a questionable shape"
 713) "    That I will speak to thee. I'll call thee Hamlet,"
 714) "    King, father, royal Dane. O, answer me?"
 715) "    Let me not burst in ignorance, but tell"
 716) "    Why thy canoniz'd bones, hearsed in death,"
 717) "    Have burst their cerements; why the sepulchre"
 718) "    Wherein we saw thee quietly inurn'd,"
 719) "    Hath op'd his ponderous and marble jaws"
 720) "    To cast thee up again. What may this mean  "
 721) "    That thou, dead corse, again in complete steel,"
 722) "    Revisits thus the glimpses of the moon,"
 723) "    Making night hideous, and we fools of nature"
 724) "    So horridly to shake our disposition"
 725) "    With thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls?"
 726) "    Say, why is this? wherefore? What should we do?"
 727) "                                           Ghost beckons Hamlet."
 728) "  Hor. It beckons you to go away with it,"
 729) "    As if it some impartment did desire"
 730) "    To you alone."
 731) "  Mar. Look with what courteous action"
 732) "    It waves you to a more removed ground."
 733) "    But do not go with it!"
 734) "  Hor. No, by no means!"
 735) "  Ham. It will not speak. Then will I follow it."
 736) "  Hor. Do not, my lord!"
 737) "  Ham. Why, what should be the fear?"
 738) "    I do not set my life at a pin's fee;"
 739) "    And for my soul, what can it do to that,"
 740) "    Being a thing immortal as itself?  "
 741) "    It waves me forth again. I'll follow it."
 742) "  Hor. What if it tempt you toward the flood, my lord,"
 743) "    Or to the dreadful summit of the cliff"
 744) "    That beetles o'er his base into the sea,"
 745) "    And there assume some other, horrible form"
 746) "    Which might deprive your sovereignty of reason"
 747) "    And draw you into madness? Think of it."
 748) "    The very place puts toys of desperation,"
 749) "    Without more motive, into every brain"
 750) "    That looks so many fadoms to the sea"
 751) "    And hears it roar beneath."
 752) "  Ham. It waves me still."
 753) "    Go on. I'll follow thee."
 754) "  Mar. You shall not go, my lord."
 755) "  Ham. Hold off your hands!"
 756) "  Hor. Be rul'd. You shall not go."
 757) "  Ham. My fate cries out"
 758) "    And makes each petty artire in this body"
 759) "    As hardy as the Nemean lion's nerve."

 812) "    That rots itself in ease on Lethe wharf,"
 813) "    Wouldst thou not stir in this. Now, Hamlet, hear."
 814) "    'Tis given out that, sleeping in my orchard,"

 831) "    Upon a wretch whose natural gifts were poor  "

 853) "    All my smooth body."
 854) "    Thus was I, sleeping, by a brother's hand"
 855) "    Of life, of crown, of queen, at once dispatch'd;"

 859) "    With all my imperfections on my head."

 861) "  Ghost. If thou hast nature in thee, bear it not."

 873) "    And shall I couple hell? Hold, hold, my heart!"
 874) "    And you, my sinews, grow not instant old,"
 875) "    But bear me stiffly up. Remember thee?"
 876) "    Ay, thou poor ghost, while memory holds a seat"
 877) "    In this distracted globe. Remember thee?"

 879) "    I'll wipe away all trivial fond records,"
 880) "    All saws of books, all forms, all pressures past"
 881) "    That youth and observation copied there,"

 900) "  Mar. How is't, my noble lord?"
 901) "  Hor. What news, my lord?"
 902) "  Mar. O, wonderful!"
 903) "  Hor. Good my lord, tell it."
 904) "  Ham. No, you will reveal it."
 905) "  Hor. Not I, my lord, by heaven!"
 906) "  Mar. Nor I, my lord."
 907) "  Ham. How say you then? Would heart of man once think it?"
 908) "    But you'll be secret?"
 909) "  Both. Ay, by heaven, my lord.  "
 910) "  Ham. There's neer a villain dwelling in all Denmark"
 911) "    But he's an arrant knave."
 912) "  Hor. There needs no ghost, my lord, come from the grave"
 913) "    To tell us this."
 914) "  Ham. Why, right! You are in the right!"
 915) "    And so, without more circumstance at all,"
 916) "    I hold it fit that we shake hands and part;"
 917) "    You, as your business and desires shall point you,"
 918) "    For every man hath business and desire,"
 919) "    Such as it is; and for my own poor part,"
 920) "    Look you, I'll go pray."
 921) "  Hor. These are but wild and whirling words, my lord."
 922) "  Ham. I am sorry they offend you, heartily;"
 923) "    Yes, faith, heartily."
 924) "  Hor. There's no offence, my lord."
 925) "  Ham. Yes, by Saint Patrick, but there is, Horatio,"
 926) "    And much offence too. Touching this vision here,"
 927) "    It is an honest ghost, that let me tell you."
 928) "    For your desire to know what is between us,"
 929) "    O'ermaster't as you may. And now, good friends,  "
 930) "    As you are friends, scholars, and soldiers,"
 931) "    Give me one poor request."
 932) "  Hor. What is't, my lord? We will."
 933) "  Ham. Never make known what you have seen to-night."
 934) "  Both. My lord, we will not."
 935) "  Ham. Nay, but swear't."
 936) "  Hor. In faith,"
 937) "    My lord, not I."
 938) "  Mar. Nor I, my lord- in faith."
 939) "  Ham. Upon my sword."
 940) "  Mar. We have sworn, my lord, already."
 941) "  Ham. Indeed, upon my sword, indeed."
 942) "                 Ghost cries under the stage."
 943) "  Ghost. Swear."
 944) "  Ham. Aha boy, say'st thou so? Art thou there, truepenny?"
 945) "    Come on! You hear this fellow in the cellarage."
 946) "    Consent to swear."
 947) "  Hor. Propose the oath, my lord.  "
 948) "  Ham. Never to speak of this that you have seen."
 949) "    Swear by my sword."
 950) "  Ghost. [beneath] Swear."
 951) "  Ham. Hic et ubique? Then we'll shift our ground."
 952) "    Come hither, gentlemen,"
 953) "    And lay your hands again upon my sword."
 954) "    Never to speak of this that you have heard:"
 955) "    Swear by my sword."
 956) "  Ghost. [beneath] Swear by his sword."
 957) "  Ham. Well said, old mole! Canst work i' th' earth so fast?"
 958) "    A worthy pioner! Once more remove, good friends.""
 959) "  Hor. O day and night, but this is wondrous strange!"
 960) "  Ham. And therefore as a stranger give it welcome."
 961) "    There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio,"
 962) "    Than are dreamt of in your philosophy."
 963) "    But come!"
 964) "    Here, as before, never, so help you mercy,"
 965) "    How strange or odd soe'er I bear myself"
 966) "    (As I perchance hereafter shall think meet"
 967) "    To put an antic disposition on),  "
 968) "    That you, at such times seeing me, never shall,"
 969) "    With arms encumb'red thus, or this head-shake,"
 970) "    Or by pronouncing of some doubtful phrase,"
 971) "    As 'Well, well, we know,' or 'We could, an if we would,'"
 972) "    Or 'If we list to speak,' or 'There be, an if they might,'"
 973) "    Or such ambiguous giving out, to note"
 974) "    That you know aught of me- this is not to do,"
 975) "    So grace and mercy at your most need help you,"
 976) "    Swear."
 977) "  Ghost. [beneath] Swear."
 978) "                                                   [They swear.]"
 979) "  Ham. Rest, rest, perturbed spirit! So, gentlemen,"
 980) "    With all my love I do commend me to you;"
 981) "    And what so poor a man as Hamlet is"
 982) "    May do t' express his love and friending to you,"
 983) "    God willing, shall not lack. Let us go in together;"
 984) "    And still your fingers on your lips, I pray."
 985) "    The time is out of joint. O cursed spite"

 995) "    Before You visit him, to make inquire"
 996) "    Of his behaviour."
 997) "  Rey. My lord, I did intend it."
 998) "  Pol. Marry, well said, very well said. Look you, sir,"
 999) "    Enquire me first what Danskers are in Paris;"
1000) "    And how, and who, what means, and where they keep,"
1001) "    What company, at what expense; and finding"
1002) "    By this encompassment and drift of question"

1009) "  Pol. 'And in part him, but,' you may say, 'not well."
1010) "    But if't be he I mean, he's very wild"
1011) "    Addicted so and so'; and there put on him"
1012) "    What forgeries you please; marry, none so rank"
1013) "    As may dishonour him- take heed of that;"
1014) "    But, sir, such wanton, wild, and usual slips"
1015) "    As are companions noted and most known"
1016) "    To youth and liberty."
1017) "  Rey. As gaming, my lord."
1018) "  Pol. Ay, or drinking, fencing, swearing, quarrelling,"

1020) "  Rey. My lord, that would dishonour him."

1022) "    You must not put another scandal on him,"

1024) "    That's not my meaning. But breathe his faults so quaintly"
1025) "    That they may seem the taints of liberty,"
1026) "    The flash and outbreak of a fiery mind,"
1027) "    A savageness in unreclaimed blood,"

1078) "  Oph. My lord, as I was sewing in my closet,"
1079) "    Lord Hamlet, with his doublet all unbrac'd,"
1080) "    No hat upon his head, his stockings foul'd,"
1081) "    Ungart'red, and down-gyved to his ankle;"

1089) "  Pol. What said he?"
1090) "  Oph. He took me by the wrist and held me hard;"
1091) "    Then goes he to the length of all his arm,"
1092) "    And, with his other hand thus o'er his brow,"
1093) "    He falls to such perusal of my face"
1094) "    As he would draw it. Long stay'd he so."
1095) "    At last, a little shaking of mine arm,"
1096) "    And thrice his head thus waving up and down,"
1097) "    He rais'd a sigh so piteous and profound"
1098) "    As it did seem to shatter all his bulk"
1099) "    And end his being. That done, he lets me go,"
1100) "    And with his head over his shoulder turn'd"

1102) "    For out o' doors he went without their help"
1103) "    And to the last bended their light on me."
1104) "  Pol. Come, go with me. I will go seek the King."
1105) "    This is the very ecstasy of love,"
1106) "    Whose violent property fordoes itself  "
1107) "    And leads the will to desperate undertakings"
1108) "    As oft as any passion under heaven"

1112) "    I did repel his letters and denied"
1113) "    His access to me."
1114) "  Pol. That hath made him mad."
1115) "    I am sorry that with better heed and judgment"
1116) "    I had not quoted him. I fear'd he did but trifle"

1240) "    But farewell it, for I will use no art.  "
1241) "    Mad let us grant him then. And now remains"

1275) "  Pol. What do you think of me?"
1276) "  King. As of a man faithful and honourable."
1277) "  Pol. I would fain prove so. But what might you think,  "
1278) "    When I had seen this hot love on the wing"
1279) "    (As I perceiv'd it, I must tell you that,"
1280) "    Before my daughter told me), what might you,"
1281) "    Or my dear Majesty your queen here, think,"
1282) "    If I had play'd the desk or table book,"
1283) "    Or given my heart a winking, mute and dumb,"
1284) "    Or look'd upon this love with idle sight?"

1286) "    And my young mistress thus I did bespeak:"
1287) "    'Lord Hamlet is a prince, out of thy star."

1290) "    Admit no messengers, receive no tokens."
1291) "    Which done, she took the fruits of my advice,"

1293) "    Fell into a sadness, then into a fast,"
1294) "    Thence to a watch, thence into a weakness,"
1295) "    Thence to a lightness, and, by this declension,"
1296) "    Into the madness wherein now he raves,"
1297) "    And all we mourn for.  "
1298) "  King. Do you think 'tis this?"
1299) "  Queen. it may be, very like."
1300) "  Pol. Hath there been such a time- I would fain know that-"
1301) "    That I have Positively said ''Tis so,'"
1302) "    When it prov'd otherwise.?"
1303) "  King. Not that I know."

1306) "    If circumstances lead me, I will find"
1307) "    Where truth is hid, though it were hid indeed"
1308) "    Within the centre."
1309) "  King. How may we try it further?"
1310) "  Pol. You know sometimes he walks four hours together"
1311) "    Here in the lobby."
1312) "  Queen. So he does indeed."
1313) "  Pol. At such a time I'll loose my daughter to him."
1314) "    Be you and I behind an arras then."
1315) "    Mark the encounter. If he love her not,"
1316) "    And he not from his reason fall'n thereon"
1317) "    Let me be no assistant for a state,  "
1318) "    But keep a farm and carters."
1319) "  King. We will try it."
1320) "                 Enter Hamlet, reading on a book."
1321) "  Queen. But look where sadly the poor wretch comes reading."
1322) "  Pol. Away, I do beseech you, both away"
1323) "    I'll board him presently. O, give me leave."
1324) "                       Exeunt King and Queen, [with Attendants]."
1325) "    How does my good Lord Hamlet?"
1326) "  Ham. Well, God-a-mercy."
1327) "  Pol. Do you know me, my lord?"
1328) "  Ham. Excellent well. You are a fishmonger."
1329) "  Pol. Not I, my lord."
1330) "  Ham. Then I would you were so honest a man."
1331) "  Pol. Honest, my lord?"
1332) "  Ham. Ay, sir. To be honest, as this world goes, is to be one man"
1333) "    pick'd out of ten thousand."
1334) "  Pol. That's very true, my lord."
1335) "  Ham. For if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog, being a god  "
1336) "    kissing carrion- Have you a daughter?"
1337) "  Pol. I have, my lord."
1338) "  Ham. Let her not walk i' th' sun. Conception is a blessing, but not"
1339) "    as your daughter may conceive. Friend, look to't."
1340) "  Pol. [aside] How say you by that? Still harping on my daughter. Yet"
1341) "    he knew me not at first. He said I was a fishmonger. He is far"
1342) "    gone, far gone! And truly in my youth I suff'red much extremity"
1343) "    for love- very near this. I'll speak to him again.- What do you"
1344) "    read, my lord?"
1345) "  Ham. Words, words, words."
1346) "  Pol. What is the matter, my lord?"
1347) "  Ham. Between who?"
1348) "  Pol. I mean, the matter that you read, my lord."
1349) "  Ham. Slanders, sir; for the satirical rogue says here that old men"
1350) "    have grey beards; that their faces are wrinkled; their eyes"
1351) "    purging thick amber and plum-tree gum; and that they have a"
1352) "    plentiful lack of wit, together with most weak hams. All which,"
1353) "    sir, though I most powerfully and potently believe, yet I hold it"
1354) "    not honesty to have it thus set down; for you yourself, sir,"
1355) "    should be old as I am if, like a crab, you could go backward.  "
1356) "  Pol. [aside] Though this be madness, yet there is a method in't.-"
1357) "   Will You walk out of the air, my lord?"
1358) "  Ham. Into my grave?"
1359) "  Pol. Indeed, that is out o' th' air. [Aside] How pregnant sometimes"
1360) "    his replies are! a happiness that often madness hits on, which"
1361) "    reason and sanity could not so prosperously be delivered of. I"
1362) "    will leave him and suddenly contrive the means of meeting between"
1363) "    him and my daughter.- My honourable lord, I will most humbly take"
1364) "    my leave of you."
1365) "  Ham. You cannot, sir, take from me anything that I will more"
1366) "    willingly part withal- except my life, except my life, except my"
1367) "    life,"
1368) "                    Enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern."
1369) "  Pol. Fare you well, my lord."
1370) "  Ham. These tedious old fools!"
1371) "  Pol. You go to seek the Lord Hamlet. There he is."
1372) "  Ros. [to Polonius] God save you, sir!"
1373) "                                                Exit [Polonius].  "
1374) "  Guil. My honour'd lord!"
1375) "  Ros. My most dear lord!"
1376) "  Ham. My excellent good friends! How dost thou, Guildenstern? Ah,"
1377) "    Rosencrantz! Good lads, how do ye both?"
1378) "  Ros. As the indifferent children of the earth."
1379) "  Guil. Happy in that we are not over-happy."
1380) "    On Fortune's cap we are not the very button."
1381) "  Ham. Nor the soles of her shoe?"
1382) "  Ros. Neither, my lord."
1383) "  Ham. Then you live about her waist, or in the middle of her"
1384) "    favours?"
1385) "  Guil. Faith, her privates we."
1386) "  Ham. In the secret parts of Fortune? O! most true! she is a"
1387) "    strumpet. What news ?"
1388) "  Ros. None, my lord, but that the world's grown honest."
1389) "  Ham. Then is doomsday near! But your news is not true. Let me"
1390) "    question more in particular. What have you, my good friends,"
1391) "    deserved at the hands of Fortune that she sends you to prison"
1392) "    hither?"
1393) "  Guil. Prison, my lord?  "
1394) "  Ham. Denmark's a prison."
1395) "  Ros. Then is the world one."
1396) "  Ham. A goodly one; in which there are many confines, wards, and"
1397) "    dungeons, Denmark being one o' th' worst."
1398) "  Ros. We think not so, my lord."
1399) "  Ham. Why, then 'tis none to you; for there is nothing either good"
1400) "    or bad but thinking makes it so. To me it is a prison."
1401) "  Ros. Why, then your ambition makes it one. 'Tis too narrow for your"
1402) "    mind."
1403) "  Ham. O God, I could be bounded in a nutshell and count myself a"
1404) "    king of infinite space, were it not that I have bad dreams."
1405) "  Guil. Which dreams indeed are ambition; for the very substance of"
1406) "    the ambitious is merely the shadow of a dream."
1407) "  Ham. A dream itself is but a shadow."
1408) "  Ros. Truly, and I hold ambition of so airy and light a quality that"
1409) "    it is but a shadow's shadow."
1410) "  Ham. Then are our beggars bodies, and our monarchs and outstretch'd"
1411) "    heroes the beggars' shadows. Shall we to th' court? for, by my"
1412) "    fay, I cannot reason."
1413) "  Both. We'll wait upon you.  "
1414) "  Ham. No such matter! I will not sort you with the rest of my"
1415) "    servants; for, to speak to you like an honest man, I am most"
1416) "    dreadfully attended. But in the beaten way of friendship, what"
1417) "    make you at Elsinore?"
1418) "  Ros. To visit you, my lord; no other occasion."
1419) "  Ham. Beggar that I am, I am even poor in thanks; but I thank you;"
1420) "    and sure, dear friends, my thanks are too dear a halfpenny. Were"
1421) "    you not sent for? Is it your own inclining? Is it a free"
1422) "    visitation? Come, deal justly with me. Come, come! Nay, speak."
1423) "  Guil. What should we say, my lord?"
1424) "  Ham. Why, anything- but to th' purpose. You were sent for; and"
1425) "    there is a kind of confession in your looks, which your modesties"
1426) "    have not craft enough to colour. I know the good King and Queen"
1427) "    have sent for you."
1428) "  Ros. To what end, my lord?"
1429) "  Ham. That you must teach me. But let me conjure you by the rights"
1430) "    of our fellowship, by the consonancy of our youth, by the"
1431) "    obligation of our ever-preserved love, and by what more dear a"
1432) "    better proposer could charge you withal, be even and direct with"
1433) "    me, whether you were sent for or no.  "
1434) "  Ros. [aside to Guildenstern] What say you?"
1435) "  Ham. [aside] Nay then, I have an eye of you.- If you love me, hold"
1436) "    not off."
1437) "  Guil. My lord, we were sent for."
1438) "  Ham. I will tell you why. So shall my anticipation prevent your"
1439) "    discovery, and your secrecy to the King and Queen moult no"
1440) "    feather. I have of late- but wherefore I know not- lost all my"
1441) "    mirth, forgone all custom of exercises; and indeed, it goes so"
1442) "    heavily with my disposition that this goodly frame, the earth,"
1443) "    seems to me a sterile promontory; this most excellent canopy, the"
1444) "    air, look you, this brave o'erhanging firmament, this majestical"
1445) "    roof fretted with golden fire- why, it appeareth no other thing"
1446) "    to me than a foul and pestilent congregation of vapours. What a"
1447) "    piece of work is a man! how noble in reason! how infinite in"
1448) "    faculties! in form and moving how express and admirable! in"
1449) "    action how like an angel! in apprehension how like a god! the"
1450) "    beauty of the world, the paragon of animals! And yet to me what"
1451) "    is this quintessence of dust? Man delights not me- no, nor woman"
1452) "    neither, though by your smiling you seem to say so."
1453) "  Ros. My lord, there was no such stuff in my thoughts.  "
1454) "  Ham. Why did you laugh then, when I said 'Man delights not me'?"
1455) "  Ros. To think, my lord, if you delight not in man, what lenten"
1456) "    entertainment the players shall receive from you. We coted them"
1457) "    on the way, and hither are they coming to offer you service."
1458) "  Ham. He that plays the king shall be welcome- his Majesty shall"
1459) "    have tribute of me; the adventurous knight shall use his foil and"
1460) "    target; the lover shall not sigh gratis; the humorous man shall"
1461) "    end his part in peace; the clown shall make those laugh whose"
1462) "    lungs are tickle o' th' sere; and the lady shall say her mind"
1463) "    freely, or the blank verse shall halt fort. What players are"
1464) "    they?"
1465) "  Ros. Even those you were wont to take such delight in, the"
1466) "    tragedians of the city."
1467) "  Ham. How chances it they travel? Their residence, both in"
1468) "    reputation and profit, was better both ways."
1469) "  Ros. I think their inhibition comes by the means of the late"
1470) "    innovation."
1471) "  Ham. Do they hold the same estimation they did when I was in the"
1472) "    city? Are they so follow'd?"
1473) "  Ros. No indeed are they not.  "
1474) "  Ham. How comes it? Do they grow rusty?"
1475) "  Ros. Nay, their endeavour keeps in the wonted pace; but there is,"
1476) "    sir, an eyrie of children, little eyases, that cry out on the top"
1477) "    of question and are most tyrannically clapp'd fort. These are now"
1478) "    the fashion, and so berattle the common stages (so they call"
1479) "    them) that many wearing rapiers are afraid of goosequills and"
1480) "    dare scarce come thither."
1481) "  Ham. What, are they children? Who maintains 'em? How are they"
1482) "    escoted? Will they pursue the quality no longer than they can"
1483) "    sing? Will they not say afterwards, if they should grow"
1484) "    themselves to common players (as it is most like, if their means"
1485) "    are no better), their writers do them wrong to make them exclaim"
1486) "    against their own succession."
1487) "  Ros. Faith, there has been much to do on both sides; and the nation"
1488) "    holds it no sin to tarre them to controversy. There was, for a"
1489) "    while, no money bid for argument unless the poet and the player"
1490) "    went to cuffs in the question."
1491) "  Ham. Is't possible?"
1492) "  Guil. O, there has been much throwing about of brains."
1493) "  Ham. Do the boys carry it away?  "
1494) "  Ros. Ay, that they do, my lord- Hercules and his load too."
1495) "  Ham. It is not very strange; for my uncle is King of Denmark, and"
1496) "    those that would make mows at him while my father lived give"
1497) "    twenty, forty, fifty, a hundred ducats apiece for his picture in"
1498) "    little. 'Sblood, there is something in this more than natural, if"
1499) "    philosophy could find it out."
1500) "                     Flourish for the Players."
1501) "  Guil. There are the players."
1502) "  Ham. Gentlemen, you are welcome to Elsinore. Your hands, come! Th'"
1503) "    appurtenance of welcome is fashion and ceremony. Let me comply"
1504) "    with you in this garb, lest my extent to the players (which I"
1505) "    tell you must show fairly outwards) should more appear like"
1506) "    entertainment than yours. You are welcome. But my uncle-father"
1507) "    and aunt-mother are deceiv'd."
1508) "  Guil. In what, my dear lord?"
1509) "  Ham. I am but mad north-north-west. When the wind is southerly I"
1510) "    know a hawk from a handsaw."
1511) "  "
1512) "                            Enter Polonius."
1513) "  Pol. Well be with you, gentlemen!"
1514) "  Ham. Hark you, Guildenstern- and you too- at each ear a hearer!"
1515) "    That great baby you see there is not yet out of his swaddling"
1516) "    clouts."
1517) "  Ros. Happily he's the second time come to them; for they say an old"
1518) "    man is twice a child."
1519) "  Ham. I will prophesy he comes to tell me of the players. Mark it.-"
1520) "   You say right, sir; a Monday morning; twas so indeed."
1521) "  Pol. My lord, I have news to tell you."
1522) "  Ham. My lord, I have news to tell you. When Roscius was an actor in"
1523) "    Rome-"
1524) "  Pol. The actors are come hither, my lord."
1525) "  Ham. Buzz, buzz!"
1526) "  Pol. Upon my honour-"
1527) "  Ham. Then came each actor on his ass-"
1528) "  Pol. The best actors in the world, either for tragedy, comedy,"
1529) "    history, pastoral, pastoral-comical, historical-pastoral,"
1530) "    tragical-historical, tragical-comical-historical-pastoral; scene  "
1531) "    individable, or poem unlimited. Seneca cannot be too heavy, nor"
1532) "    Plautus too light. For the law of writ and the liberty, these are"
1533) "    the only men."
1534) "  Ham. O Jephthah, judge of Israel, what a treasure hadst thou!"
1535) "  Pol. What treasure had he, my lord?"
1536) "  Ham. Why,"
1537) "         'One fair daughter, and no more,"
1538) "           The which he loved passing well.'"
1539) "  Pol. [aside] Still on my daughter."
1540) "  Ham. Am I not i' th' right, old Jephthah?"
1541) "  Pol. If you call me Jephthah, my lord, I have a daughter that I"
1542) "    love passing well."
1543) "  Ham. Nay, that follows not."
1544) "  Pol. What follows then, my lord?"
1545) "  Ham. Why,"
1546) "           'As by lot, God wot,'"
1547) " and then, you know,"
1548) "  "
1549) "           'It came to pass, as most like it was.'"
1550) "    The first row of the pious chanson will show you more; for look"
1551) "    where my abridgment comes."
1552) "                     Enter four or five Players."
1553) "    You are welcome, masters; welcome, all.- I am glad to see thee"
1554) "    well.- Welcome, good friends.- O, my old friend? Why, thy face is"
1555) "    valanc'd since I saw thee last. Com'st' thou to' beard me in"
1556) "    Denmark?- What, my young lady and mistress? By'r Lady, your"
1557) "    ladyship is nearer to heaven than when I saw you last by the"
1558) "    altitude of a chopine. Pray God your voice, like a piece of"
1559) "    uncurrent gold, be not crack'd within the ring.- Masters, you are"
1560) "    all welcome. We'll e'en to't like French falconers, fly at"
1561) "    anything we see. We'll have a speech straight. Come, give us a"
1562) "    taste of your quality. Come, a passionate speech."
1563) "  1. Play. What speech, my good lord?"
1564) "  Ham. I heard thee speak me a speech once, but it was never acted;"
1565) "    or if it was, not above once; for the play, I remember, pleas'd  "
1566) "    not the million, 'twas caviary to the general; but it was (as I"
1567) "    receiv'd it, and others, whose judgments in such matters cried in"
1568) "    the top of mine) an excellent play, well digested in the scenes,"
1569) "    set down with as much modesty as cunning. I remember one said"
1570) "    there were no sallets in the lines to make the matter savoury,"
1571) "    nor no matter in the phrase that might indict the author of"
1572) "    affectation; but call'd it an honest method, as wholesome as"
1573) "    sweet, and by very much more handsome than fine. One speech in't"
1574) "    I chiefly lov'd. 'Twas AEneas' tale to Dido, and thereabout of it"
1575) "    especially where he speaks of Priam's slaughter. If it live in"
1576) "    your memory, begin at this line- let me see, let me see:"
1577) "         'The rugged Pyrrhus, like th' Hyrcanian beast-'"
1578) "    'Tis not so; it begins with Pyrrhus:"
1579) "         'The rugged Pyrrhus, he whose sable arms,"
1580) "         Black as his purpose, did the night resemble"
1581) "         When he lay couched in the ominous horse,"
1582) "         Hath now this dread and black complexion smear'd  "
1583) "         With heraldry more dismal. Head to foot"
1584) "         Now is be total gules, horridly trick'd"
1585) "         With blood of fathers, mothers, daughters, sons,"
1586) "         Bak'd and impasted with the parching streets,"
1587) "         That lend a tyrannous and a damned light"
1588) "         To their lord's murther. Roasted in wrath and fire,"
1589) "         And thus o'ersized with coagulate gore,"
1590) "         With eyes like carbuncles, the hellish Pyrrhus"
1591) "         Old grandsire Priam seeks.'"
1592) "    So, proceed you."
1593) "  Pol. Fore God, my lord, well spoken, with good accent and good"
1594) "     discretion."
1595) "  1. Play. 'Anon he finds him,"
1596) "      Striking too short at Greeks. His antique sword,"
1597) "      Rebellious to his arm, lies where it falls,"
1598) "      Repugnant to command. Unequal match'd,"
1599) "      Pyrrhus at Priam drives, in rage strikes wide;"
1600) "      But with the whiff and wind of his fell sword  "
1601) "      Th' unnerved father falls. Then senseless Ilium,"
1602) "      Seeming to feel this blow, with flaming top"
1603) "      Stoops to his base, and with a hideous crash"
1604) "      Takes prisoner Pyrrhus' ear. For lo! his sword,"
1605) "      Which was declining on the milky head"
1606) "      Of reverend Priam, seem'd i' th' air to stick."
1607) "      So, as a painted tyrant, Pyrrhus stood,"
1608) "      And, like a neutral to his will and matter,"
1609) "      Did nothing."
1610) "      But, as we often see, against some storm,"
1611) "      A silence in the heavens, the rack stand still,"
1612) "      The bold winds speechless, and the orb below"
1613) "      As hush as death- anon the dreadful thunder"
1614) "      Doth rend the region; so, after Pyrrhus' pause,"
1615) "      Aroused vengeance sets him new awork;"
1616) "      And never did the Cyclops' hammers fall"
1617) "      On Mars's armour, forg'd for proof eterne,"
1618) "      With less remorse than Pyrrhus' bleeding sword"
1619) "      Now falls on Priam."
1620) "      Out, out, thou strumpet Fortune! All you gods,  "
1621) "      In general synod take away her power;"
1622) "      Break all the spokes and fellies from her wheel,"
1623) "      And bowl the round nave down the hill of heaven,"
1624) "      As low as to the fiends!"
1625) "  Pol. This is too long."
1626) "  Ham. It shall to the barber's, with your beard.- Prithee say on."
1627) "    He's for a jig or a tale of bawdry, or he sleeps. Say on; come to"
1628) "    Hecuba."
1629) "  1. Play. 'But who, O who, had seen the mobled queen-'"
1630) "  Ham. 'The mobled queen'?"
1631) "  Pol. That's good! 'Mobled queen' is good."
1632) "  1. Play. 'Run barefoot up and down, threat'ning the flames"
1633) "      With bisson rheum; a clout upon that head"
1634) "      Where late the diadem stood, and for a robe,"
1635) "      About her lank and all o'erteemed loins,"
1636) "      A blanket, in the alarm of fear caught up-  "
1637) "      Who this had seen, with tongue in venom steep'd"
1638) "      'Gainst Fortune's state would treason have pronounc'd."
1639) "      But if the gods themselves did see her then,"
1640) "      When she saw Pyrrhus make malicious sport"
1641) "      In Mincing with his sword her husband's limbs,"
1642) "      The instant burst of clamour that she made"
1643) "      (Unless things mortal move them not at all)"
1644) "      Would have made milch the burning eyes of heaven"
1645) "      And passion in the gods.'"
1646) "  Pol. Look, whe'r he has not turn'd his colour, and has tears in's"
1647) "    eyes. Prithee no more!"
1648) "  Ham. 'Tis well. I'll have thee speak out the rest of this soon.-"
1649) "    Good my lord, will you see the players well bestow'd? Do you"
1650) "    hear? Let them be well us'd; for they are the abstract and brief"
1651) "    chronicles of the time. After your death you were better have a"
1652) "    bad epitaph than their ill report while you live."
1653) "  Pol. My lord, I will use them according to their desert."
1654) "  Ham. God's bodykins, man, much better! Use every man after his"
1655) "    desert, and who should scape whipping? Use them after your own  "
1656) "    honour and dignity. The less they deserve, the more merit is in"
1657) "    your bounty. Take them in."
1658) "  Pol. Come, sirs."
1659) "  Ham. Follow him, friends. We'll hear a play to-morrow."
1660) "                 Exeunt Polonius and Players [except the First]."
1661) "    Dost thou hear me, old friend? Can you play 'The Murther of"
1662) "    Gonzago'?"
1663) "  1. Play. Ay, my lord."
1664) "  Ham. We'll ha't to-morrow night. You could, for a need, study a"
1665) "    speech of some dozen or sixteen lines which I would set down and"
1666) "    insert in't, could you not?"
1667) "  1. Play. Ay, my lord."
1668) "  Ham. Very well. Follow that lord- and look you mock him not."
1669) "                                            [Exit First Player.]"
1670) "    My good friends, I'll leave you till night. You are welcome to"
1671) "    Elsinore."
1672) "  Ros. Good my lord!"
1673) "  Ham. Ay, so, God b' wi' ye!"
1674) "                            [Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern"
1675) "    Now I am alone.  "
1676) "    O what a rogue and peasant slave am I!"
1677) "    Is it not monstrous that this player here,"
1678) "    But in a fiction, in a dream of passion,"
1679) "    Could force his soul so to his own conceit"
1680) "    That, from her working, all his visage wann'd,"
1681) "    Tears in his eyes, distraction in's aspect,"
1682) "    A broken voice, and his whole function suiting"
1683) "    With forms to his conceit? And all for nothing!"
1684) "    For Hecuba!"
1685) "    What's Hecuba to him, or he to Hecuba,"
1686) "    That he should weep for her? What would he do,"
1687) "    Had he the motive and the cue for passion"
1688) "    That I have? He would drown the stage with tears"
1689) "    And cleave the general ear with horrid speech;"
1690) "    Make mad the guilty and appal the free,"
1691) "    Confound the ignorant, and amaze indeed"
1692) "    The very faculties of eyes and ears."
1693) "    Yet I,"
1694) "    A dull and muddy-mettled rascal, peak"
1695) "    Like John-a-dreams, unpregnant of my cause,  "
1696) "    And can say nothing! No, not for a king,"
1697) "    Upon whose property and most dear life"
1698) "    A damn'd defeat was made. Am I a coward?"
1699) "    Who calls me villain? breaks my pate across?"
1700) "    Plucks off my beard and blows it in my face?"
1701) "    Tweaks me by th' nose? gives me the lie i' th' throat"
1702) "    As deep as to the lungs? Who does me this, ha?"
1703) "    'Swounds, I should take it! for it cannot be"
1704) "    But I am pigeon-liver'd and lack gall"
1705) "    To make oppression bitter, or ere this"
1706) "    I should have fatted all the region kites"
1707) "    With this slave's offal. Bloody bawdy villain!"
1708) "    Remorseless, treacherous, lecherous, kindless villain!"
1709) "    O, vengeance!"
1710) "    Why, what an ass am I! This is most brave,"
1711) "    That I, the son of a dear father murther'd,"
1712) "    Prompted to my revenge by heaven and hell,"
1713) "    Must (like a whore) unpack my heart with words"
1714) "    And fall a-cursing like a very drab,"
1715) "    A scullion!  "
1716) "    Fie upon't! foh! About, my brain! Hum, I have heard"
1717) "    That guilty creatures, sitting at a play,"
1718) "    Have by the very cunning of the scene"
1719) "    Been struck so to the soul that presently"
1720) "    They have proclaim'd their malefactions;"
1721) "    For murther, though it have no tongue, will speak"
1722) "    With most miraculous organ, I'll have these Players"
1723) "    Play something like the murther of my father"
1724) "    Before mine uncle. I'll observe his looks;"
1725) "    I'll tent him to the quick. If he but blench,"
1726) "    I know my course. The spirit that I have seen"
1727) "    May be a devil; and the devil hath power"
1728) "    T' assume a pleasing shape; yea, and perhaps"
1729) "    Out of my weakness and my melancholy,"
1730) "    As he is very potent with such spirits,"
1731) "    Abuses me to damn me. I'll have grounds"
1732) "    More relative than this. The play's the thing"
1733) "    Wherein I'll catch the conscience of the King.         Exit."
1734) "ACT III. Scene I."
1735) "Elsinore. A room in the Castle."
1736) "Enter King, Queen, Polonius, Ophelia, Rosencrantz, Guildenstern, and Lords."
1737) "  King. And can you by no drift of circumstance"
1738) "    Get from him why he puts on this confusion,"
1739) "    Grating so harshly all his days of quiet"
1740) "    With turbulent and dangerous lunacy?"
1741) "  Ros. He does confess he feels himself distracted,"
1742) "    But from what cause he will by no means speak."
1743) "  Guil. Nor do we find him forward to be sounded,"
1744) "    But with a crafty madness keeps aloof"
1745) "    When we would bring him on to some confession"
1746) "    Of his true state."
1747) "  Queen. Did he receive you well?"
1748) "  Ros. Most like a gentleman."
1749) "  Guil. But with much forcing of his disposition."
1750) "  Ros. Niggard of question, but of our demands"
1751) "    Most free in his reply."
1752) "  Queen. Did you assay him  "
1753) "    To any pastime?"
1754) "  Ros. Madam, it so fell out that certain players"
1755) "    We o'erraught on the way. Of these we told him,"
1756) "    And there did seem in him a kind of joy"
1757) "    To hear of it. They are here about the court,"
1758) "    And, as I think, they have already order"
1759) "    This night to play before him."
1760) "  Pol. 'Tis most true;"
1761) "    And he beseech'd me to entreat your Majesties"
1762) "    To hear and see the matter."
1763) "  King. With all my heart, and it doth much content me"
1764) "    To hear him so inclin'd."
1765) "    Good gentlemen, give him a further edge"
1766) "    And drive his purpose on to these delights."
1767) "  Ros. We shall, my lord."
1768) "                            Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern."
1769) "  King. Sweet Gertrude, leave us too;"
1770) "    For we have closely sent for Hamlet hither,"
1771) "    That he, as 'twere by accident, may here"
1772) "    Affront Ophelia.  "
1773) "    Her father and myself (lawful espials)"
1774) "    Will so bestow ourselves that, seeing unseen,"
1775) "    We may of their encounter frankly judge"
1776) "    And gather by him, as he is behav'd,"
1777) "    If't be th' affliction of his love, or no,"
1778) "    That thus he suffers for."
1779) "  Queen. I shall obey you;"
1780) "    And for your part, Ophelia, I do wish"
1781) "    That your good beauties be the happy cause"
1782) "    Of Hamlet's wildness. So shall I hope your virtues"
1783) "    Will bring him to his wonted way again,"
1784) "    To both your honours."
1785) "  Oph. Madam, I wish it may."
1786) "                                                   [Exit Queen.]"
1787) "  Pol. Ophelia, walk you here.- Gracious, so please you,"
1788) "    We will bestow ourselves.- [To Ophelia] Read on this book,"
1789) "    That show of such an exercise may colour"
1790) "    Your loneliness.- We are oft to blame in this,"
1791) "    'Tis too much prov'd, that with devotion's visage"
1792) "    And pious action we do sugar o'er  "
1793) "    The Devil himself."
1794) "  King. [aside] O, 'tis too true!"
1795) "    How smart a lash that speech doth give my conscience!"
1796) "    The harlot's cheek, beautied with plast'ring art,"
1797) "    Is not more ugly to the thing that helps it"
1798) "    Than is my deed to my most painted word."

1803) "  Ham. To be, or not to be- that is the question:"
1804) "    Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer"
1805) "    The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune"
1806) "    Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,"
1807) "    And by opposing end them. To die- to sleep-"
1808) "    No more; and by a sleep to say we end"
1809) "    The heartache, and the thousand natural shocks"
1810) "    That flesh is heir to. 'Tis a consummation  "
1811) "    Devoutly to be wish'd. To die- to sleep."
1812) "    To sleep- perchance to dream: ay, there's the rub!"
1813) "    For in that sleep of death what dreams may come"
1814) "    When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,"
1815) "    Must give us pause. There's the respect"
1816) "    That makes calamity of so long life."

1830) "    Thus conscience does make cowards of us all,  "
1831) "    And thus the native hue of resolution"
1832) "    Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought,"

1856) "  Ham. That if you be honest and fair, your honesty should admit no"
1857) "    discourse to your beauty."
1858) "  Oph. Could beauty, my lord, have better commerce than with honesty?"
1859) "  Ham. Ay, truly; for the power of beauty will sooner transform"
1860) "    honesty from what it is to a bawd than the force of honesty can"
1861) "    translate beauty into his likeness. This was sometime a paradox,"
1862) "    but now the time gives it proof. I did love you once."

1870) "    me of such things that it were better my mother had not borne me.  "
1871) "    I am very proud, revengeful, ambitious; with more offences at my"

2034) "  King. I have nothing with this answer, Hamlet. These words are not"
2035) "    mine."

2038) "  Pol. That did I, my lord, and was accounted a good actor."
2039) "  Ham. What did you enact?"
2040) "  Pol. I did enact Julius Caesar; I was kill'd i' th' Capitol; Brutus"
2041) "    kill'd me."
2042) "  Ham. It was a brute part of him to kill so capital a calf there. Be"

2044) "  Ros. Ay, my lord. They stay upon your patience."
2045) "  Queen. Come hither, my dear Hamlet, sit by me."

2067) "    yet? Then there's hope a great man's memory may outlive his life"

2076) "    him asleep, leaves him. Anon comes in a fellow, takes off his"
2077) "    crown, kisses it, pours poison in the sleeper's ears, and"
2078) "    leaves him. The Queen returns, finds the King dead, and makes"

2080) "    comes in again, seem to condole with her. The dead body is"

2088) "                      Enter Prologue."
2089) "  Ham. We shall know by this fellow. The players cannot keep counsel;"
2090) "    they'll tell all."
2091) "  Oph. Will he tell us what this show meant?"
2092) "  Ham. Ay, or any show that you'll show him. Be not you asham'd to"
2093) "    show, he'll not shame to tell you what it means."
2094) "  Oph. You are naught, you are naught! I'll mark the play."

2131) "      Are base respects of thrift, but none of love."
2132) "      A second time I kill my husband dead"
2133) "      When second husband kisses me in bed."
2134) "    King. I do believe you think what now you speak;"
2135) "      But what we do determine oft we break."
2136) "      Purpose is but the slave to memory,"
2137) "      Of violent birth, but poor validity;"
2138) "      Which now, like fruit unripe, sticks on the tree,  "
2139) "      But fill unshaken when they mellow be."
2140) "      Most necessary 'tis that we forget"
2141) "      To pay ourselves what to ourselves is debt."
2142) "      What to ourselves in passion we propose,"
2143) "      The passion ending, doth the purpose lose."
2144) "      The violence of either grief or joy"
2145) "      Their own enactures with themselves destroy."
2146) "      Where joy most revels, grief doth most lament;"

2148) "      This world is not for aye, nor 'tis not strange"
2149) "      That even our loves should with our fortunes change;"
2150) "      For 'tis a question left us yet to prove,"
2151) "      Whether love lead fortune, or else fortune love."
2152) "      The great man down, you mark his favourite flies,"
2153) "      The poor advanc'd makes friends of enemies;"
2154) "      And hitherto doth love on fortune tend,"
2155) "      For who not needs shall never lack a friend,"
2156) "      And who in want a hollow friend doth try,"
2157) "      Directly seasons him his enemy."
2158) "      But, orderly to end where I begun,  "
2159) "      Our wills and fates do so contrary run"
2160) "      That our devices still are overthrown;"
2161) "      Our thoughts are ours, their ends none of our own."
2162) "      So think thou wilt no second husband wed;"
2163) "      But die thy thoughts when thy first lord is dead."
2164) "    Queen. Nor earth to me give food, nor heaven light,"
2165) "      Sport and repose lock from me day and night,"

2172) "  Ham. If she should break it now!"
2173) "    King. 'Tis deeply sworn. Sweet, leave me here awhile."
2174) "      My spirits grow dull, and fain I would beguile"
2175) "      The tedious day with sleep."

2180) "  Ham. Madam, how like you this play?"
2181) "  Queen. The lady doth protest too much, methinks."
2182) "  Ham. O, but she'll keep her word."
2183) "  King. Have you heard the argument? Is there no offence in't?"
2184) "  Ham. No, no! They do but jest, poison in jest; no offence i' th'"
2185) "    world."
2186) "  King. What do you call the play?"
2187) "  Ham. 'The Mousetrap.' Marry, how? Tropically. This play is the"
2188) "    image of a murther done in Vienna. Gonzago is the duke's name;"
2189) "    his wife, Baptista. You shall see anon. 'Tis a knavish piece of"
2190) "    work; but what o' that? Your Majesty, and we that have free"
2191) "    souls, it touches us not. Let the gall'd jade winch; our withers"
2192) "    are unwrung."
2193) "                         Enter Lucianus."
2194) "  "

2196) "  Oph. You are as good as a chorus, my lord."
2197) "  Ham. I could interpret between you and your love, if I could see"
2198) "    the puppets dallying."
2199) "  Oph. You are keen, my lord, you are keen."
2200) "  Ham. It would cost you a groaning to take off my edge."
2201) "  Oph. Still better, and worse."
2202) "  Ham. So you must take your husbands.- Begin, murtherer. Pox, leave"
2203) "    thy damnable faces, and begin! Come, the croaking raven doth"
2204) "    bellow for revenge."
2205) "    Luc. Thoughts black, hands apt, drugs fit, and time agreeing;"
2206) "      Confederate season, else no creature seeing;"
2207) "      Thou mixture rank, of midnight weeds collected,"
2208) "      With Hecate's ban thrice blasted, thrice infected,"

2212) "  Ham. He poisons him i' th' garden for's estate. His name's Gonzago.  "
2213) "    The story is extant, and written in very choice Italian. You"
2214) "    shall see anon how the murtherer gets the love of Gonzago's wife."
2215) "  Oph. The King rises."
2216) "  Ham. What, frighted with false fire?"
2217) "  Queen. How fares my lord?"
2218) "  Pol. Give o'er the play."
2219) "  King. Give me some light! Away!"

2221) "                              Exeunt all but Hamlet and Horatio."
2222) "  Ham.   Why, let the strucken deer go weep,"
2223) "          The hart ungalled play;"
2224) "         For some must watch, while some must sleep:"
2225) "          Thus runs the world away."
2226) "    Would not this, sir, and a forest of feathers- if the rest of my"
2227) "    fortunes turn Turk with me-with two Provincial roses on my raz'd"
2228) "    shoes, get me a fellowship in a cry of players, sir?"
2229) "  Hor. Half a share."

2236) "  Ham. O good Horatio, I'll take the ghost's word for a thousand"
2237) "    pound! Didst perceive?"
2238) "  Hor. Very well, my lord."
2239) "  Ham. Upon the talk of the poisoning?"
2240) "  Hor. I did very well note him."
2241) "  Ham.   Aha! Come, some music! Come, the recorders!"
2242) "         For if the King like not the comedy,"
2243) "         Why then, belike he likes it not, perdy."
2244) "    Come, some music!"
2245) "                Enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern."
2246) "  Guil. Good my lord, vouchsafe me a word with you."
2247) "  Ham. Sir, a whole history."
2248) "  Guil. The King, sir-"
2249) "  Ham. Ay, sir, what of him?"
2250) "  Guil. Is in his retirement, marvellous distemper'd.  "
2251) "  Ham. With drink, sir?"
2252) "  Guil. No, my lord; rather with choler."
2253) "  Ham. Your wisdom should show itself more richer to signify this to"
2254) "    the doctor; for me to put him to his purgation would perhaps"
2255) "    plunge him into far more choler."
2256) "  Guil. Good my lord, put your discourse into some frame, and start"
2257) "    not so wildly from my affair."
2258) "  Ham. I am tame, sir; pronounce."
2259) "  Guil. The Queen, your mother, in most great affliction of spirit"
2260) "    hath sent me to you."
2261) "  Ham. You are welcome."
2262) "  Guil. Nay, good my lord, this courtesy is not of the right breed."
2263) "    If it shall please you to make me a wholesome answer, I will do"
2264) "    your mother's commandment; if not, your pardon and my return"
2265) "    shall be the end of my business."
2266) "  Ham. Sir, I cannot."
2267) "  Guil. What, my lord?"
2268) "  Ham. Make you a wholesome answer; my wit's diseas'd. But, sir, such"
2269) "    answer is I can make, you shall command; or rather, as you say,"
2270) "    my mother. Therefore no more, but to the matter! My mother, you  "
2271) "    say-"
2272) "  Ros. Then thus she says: your behaviour hath struck her into"
2273) "    amazement and admiration."
2274) "  Ham. O wonderful son, that can so stonish a mother! But is there no"
2275) "    sequel at the heels of this mother's admiration? Impart."
2276) "  Ros. She desires to speak with you in her closet ere you go to bed."
2277) "  Ham. We shall obey, were she ten times our mother. Have you any"
2278) "    further trade with us?"
2279) "  Ros. My lord, you once did love me."
2280) "  Ham. And do still, by these pickers and stealers!"
2281) "  Ros. Good my lord, what is your cause of distemper? You do surely"
2282) "    bar the door upon your own liberty, if you deny your griefs to"
2283) "    your friend."
2284) "  Ham. Sir, I lack advancement."
2285) "  Ros. How can that be, when you have the voice of the King himself"
2286) "    for your succession in Denmark?"
2287) "  Ham. Ay, sir, but 'while the grass grows'- the proverb is something"
2288) "    musty."
2289) "                     Enter the Players with recorders.  "
2290) "    O, the recorders! Let me see one. To withdraw with you- why do"
2291) "    you go about to recover the wind of me, as if you would drive me"
2292) "    into a toil?"
2293) "  Guil. O my lord, if my duty be too bold, my love is too unmannerly."
2294) "  Ham. I do not well understand that. Will you play upon this pipe?"
2295) "  Guil. My lord, I cannot."
2296) "  Ham. I pray you."
2297) "  Guil. Believe me, I cannot."
2298) "  Ham. I do beseech you."
2299) "  Guil. I know, no touch of it, my lord."
2300) "  Ham. It is as easy as lying. Govern these ventages with your"
2301) "    fingers and thumbs, give it breath with your mouth, and it will"
2302) "    discourse most eloquent music. Look you, these are the stops."
2303) "  Guil. But these cannot I command to any utt'rance of harmony. I"
2304) "    have not the skill."
2305) "  Ham. Why, look you now, how unworthy a thing you make of me! You"
2306) "    would play upon me; you would seem to know my stops; you would"
2307) "    pluck out the heart of my mystery; you would sound me from my"
2308) "    lowest note to the top of my compass; and there is much music,  "
2309) "    excellent voice, in this little organ, yet cannot you make it"
2310) "    speak. 'Sblood, do you think I am easier to be play'd on than a"
2311) "    pipe? Call me what instrument you will, though you can fret me,"
2312) "    you cannot play upon me."
2313) "                        Enter Polonius."
2314) "    God bless you, sir!"
2315) "  Pol. My lord, the Queen would speak with you, and presently."
2316) "  Ham. Do you see yonder cloud that's almost in shape of a camel?"
2317) "  Pol. By th' mass, and 'tis like a camel indeed."
2318) "  Ham. Methinks it is like a weasel."
2319) "  Pol. It is back'd like a weasel."
2320) "  Ham. Or like a whale."
2321) "  Pol. Very like a whale."
2322) "  Ham. Then will I come to my mother by-and-by.- They fool me to the"
2323) "    top of my bent.- I will come by-and-by."
2324) "  Pol. I will say so.                                      Exit."
2325) "  Ham. 'By-and-by' is easily said.- Leave me, friends."
2326) "                                        [Exeunt all but Hamlet.]  "
2327) "    'Tis now the very witching time of night,"
2328) "    When churchyards yawn, and hell itself breathes out"
2329) "    Contagion to this world. Now could I drink hot blood"
2330) "    And do such bitter business as the day"
2331) "    Would quake to look on. Soft! now to my mother!"
2332) "    O heart, lose not thy nature; let not ever"
2333) "    The soul of Nero enter this firm bosom."
2334) "    Let me be cruel, not unnatural;"
2335) "    I will speak daggers to her, but use none."
2336) "    My tongue and soul in this be hypocrites-"
2337) "    How in my words somever she be shent,"
2338) "    To give them seals never, my soul, consent!             Exit."
2339) "Scene III."
2340) "A room in the Castle."
2341) "Enter King, Rosencrantz, and Guildenstern."
2342) "  King. I like him not, nor stands it safe with us"
2343) "    To let his madness range. Therefore prepare you;"
2344) "    I your commission will forthwith dispatch,"
2345) "    And he to England shall along with you."
2346) "    The terms of our estate may not endure"
2347) "    Hazard so near us as doth hourly grow"
2348) "    Out of his lunacies."
2349) "  Guil. We will ourselves provide."
2350) "    Most holy and religious fear it is"
2351) "    To keep those many many bodies safe"
2352) "    That live and feed upon your Majesty."
2353) "  Ros. The single and peculiar life is bound"
2354) "    With all the strength and armour of the mind"
2355) "    To keep itself from noyance; but much more"
2356) "    That spirit upon whose weal depends and rests"
2357) "    The lives of many. The cesse of majesty"
2358) "    Dies not alone, but like a gulf doth draw  "
2359) "    What's near it with it. It is a massy wheel,"
2360) "    Fix'd on the summit of the highest mount,"
2361) "    To whose huge spokes ten thousand lesser things"
2362) "    Are mortis'd and adjoin'd; which when it falls,"
2363) "    Each small annexment, petty consequence,"
2364) "    Attends the boist'rous ruin. Never alone"
2365) "    Did the king sigh, but with a general groan."
2366) "  King. Arm you, I pray you, to th', speedy voyage;"
2367) "    For we will fetters put upon this fear,"
2368) "    Which now goes too free-footed."
2369) "  Both. We will haste us."
2370) "                                               Exeunt Gentlemen."
2371) "                   Enter Polonius."
2372) "  Pol. My lord, he's going to his mother's closet."
2373) "    Behind the arras I'll convey myself"
2374) "    To hear the process. I'll warrant she'll tax him home;"
2375) "    And, as you said, and wisely was it said,"
2376) "    'Tis meet that some more audience than a mother,  "
2377) "    Since nature makes them partial, should o'erhear"
2378) "    The speech, of vantage. Fare you well, my liege."
2379) "    I'll call upon you ere you go to bed"
2380) "    And tell you what I know."
2381) "  King. Thanks, dear my lord."
2382) "                                                Exit [Polonius]."
2383) "    O, my offence is rank, it smells to heaven;"
2384) "    It hath the primal eldest curse upon't,"
2385) "    A brother's murther! Pray can I not,"
2386) "    Though inclination be as sharp as will."
2387) "    My stronger guilt defeats my strong intent,"
2388) "    And, like a man to double business bound,"
2389) "    I stand in pause where I shall first begin,"
2390) "    And both neglect. What if this cursed hand"
2391) "    Were thicker than itself with brother's blood,"
2392) "    Is there not rain enough in the sweet heavens"
2393) "    To wash it white as snow? Whereto serves mercy"
2394) "    But to confront the visage of offence?"
2395) "    And what's in prayer but this twofold force,"
2396) "    To be forestalled ere we come to fall,  "
2397) "    Or pardon'd being down? Then I'll look up;"
2398) "    My fault is past. But, O, what form of prayer"
2399) "    Can serve my turn? 'Forgive me my foul murther'?"
2400) "    That cannot be; since I am still possess'd"
2401) "    Of those effects for which I did the murther-"
2402) "    My crown, mine own ambition, and my queen."
2403) "    May one be pardon'd and retain th' offence?"
2404) "    In the corrupted currents of this world"
2405) "    Offence's gilded hand may shove by justice,"
2406) "    And oft 'tis seen the wicked prize itself"
2407) "    Buys out the law; but 'tis not so above."
2408) "    There is no shuffling; there the action lies"
2409) "    In his true nature, and we ourselves compell'd,"
2410) "    Even to the teeth and forehead of our faults,"
2411) "    To give in evidence. What then? What rests?"
2412) "    Try what repentance can. What can it not?"
2413) "    Yet what can it when one cannot repent?"
2414) "    O wretched state! O bosom black as death!"
2415) "    O limed soul, that, struggling to be free,"
2416) "    Art more engag'd! Help, angels! Make assay.  "
2417) "    Bow, stubborn knees; and heart with strings of steel,"
2418) "    Be soft as sinews of the new-born babe!"
2419) "    All may be well.                                  He kneels."
2420) "                         Enter Hamlet."
2421) "  Ham. Now might I do it pat, now he is praying;"
2422) "    And now I'll do't. And so he goes to heaven,"
2423) "    And so am I reveng'd. That would be scann'd."
2424) "    A villain kills my father; and for that,"
2425) "    I, his sole son, do this same villain send"
2426) "    To heaven."
2427) "    Why, this is hire and salary, not revenge!"
2428) "    He took my father grossly, full of bread,"
2429) "    With all his crimes broad blown, as flush as May;"
2430) "    And how his audit stands, who knows save heaven?"
2431) "    But in our circumstance and course of thought,"
2432) "    'Tis heavy with him; and am I then reveng'd,"
2433) "    To take him in the purging of his soul,"
2434) "    When he is fit and seasoned for his passage?  "
2435) "    No."
2436) "    Up, sword, and know thou a more horrid hent."
2437) "    When he is drunk asleep; or in his rage;"
2438) "    Or in th' incestuous pleasure of his bed;"
2439) "    At gaming, swearing, or about some act"
2440) "    That has no relish of salvation in't-"
2441) "    Then trip him, that his heels may kick at heaven,"
2442) "    And that his soul may be as damn'd and black"
2443) "    As hell, whereto it goes. My mother stays."
2444) "    This physic but prolongs thy sickly days.              Exit."
2445) "  King. [rises] My words fly up, my thoughts remain below."
2446) "    Words without thoughts never to heaven go.             Exit."
2447) "Scene IV."
2448) "The Queen's closet."
2449) "Enter Queen and Polonius."
2450) "  Pol. He will come straight. Look you lay home to him."
2451) "    Tell him his pranks have been too broad to bear with,"
2452) "    And that your Grace hath screen'd and stood between"
2453) "    Much heat and him. I'll silence me even here."
2454) "    Pray you be round with him."
2455) "  Ham. (within) Mother, mother, mother!"
2456) "  Queen. I'll warrant you; fear me not. Withdraw; I hear him coming."
2457) "                              [Polonius hides behind the arras.]"
2458) "                          Enter Hamlet."
2459) "  Ham. Now, mother, what's the matter?"
2460) "  Queen. Hamlet, thou hast thy father much offended."
2461) "  Ham. Mother, you have my father much offended."
2462) "  Queen. Come, come, you answer with an idle tongue."
2463) "  Ham. Go, go, you question with a wicked tongue."
2464) "  Queen. Why, how now, Hamlet?  "
2465) "  Ham. What's the matter now?"
2466) "  Queen. Have you forgot me?"
2467) "  Ham. No, by the rood, not so!"
2468) "    You are the Queen, your husband's brother's wife,"
2469) "    And (would it were not so!) you are my mother."
2470) "  Queen. Nay, then I'll set those to you that can speak."
2471) "  Ham. Come, come, and sit you down. You shall not budge I"
2472) "    You go not till I set you up a glass"
2473) "    Where you may see the inmost part of you."
2474) "  Queen. What wilt thou do? Thou wilt not murther me?"
2475) "    Help, help, ho!"
2476) "  Pol. [behind] What, ho! help, help, help!"
2477) "  Ham. [draws] How now? a rat? Dead for a ducat, dead!"
2478) "            [Makes a pass through the arras and] kills Polonius."
2479) "  Pol. [behind] O, I am slain!"
2480) "  Queen. O me, what hast thou done?"
2481) "  Ham. Nay, I know not. Is it the King?"
2482) "  Queen. O, what a rash and bloody deed is this!"
2483) "  Ham. A bloody deed- almost as bad, good mother,"
2484) "    As kill a king, and marry with his brother.  "
2485) "  Queen. As kill a king?"
2486) "  Ham. Ay, lady, it was my word."
2487) "                         [Lifts up the arras and sees Polonius.]"
2488) "    Thou wretched, rash, intruding fool, farewell!"
2489) "    I took thee for thy better. Take thy fortune."
2490) "    Thou find'st to be too busy is some danger."
2491) "    Leave wringing of your hinds. Peace! sit you down"
2492) "    And let me wring your heart; for so I shall"
2493) "    If it be made of penetrable stuff;"
2494) "    If damned custom have not braz'd it so"
2495) "    That it is proof and bulwark against sense."
2496) "  Queen. What have I done that thou dar'st wag thy tongue"
2497) "    In noise so rude against me?"
2498) "  Ham. Such an act"
2499) "    That blurs the grace and blush of modesty;"
2500) "    Calls virtue hypocrite; takes off the rose"
2501) "    From the fair forehead of an innocent love,"
2502) "    And sets a blister there; makes marriage vows"
2503) "    As false as dicers' oaths. O, such a deed"
2504) "    As from the body of contraction plucks  "
2505) "    The very soul, and sweet religion makes"
2506) "    A rhapsody of words! Heaven's face doth glow;"
2507) "    Yea, this solidity and compound mass,"
2508) "    With tristful visage, as against the doom,"
2509) "    Is thought-sick at the act."
2510) "  Queen. Ay me, what act,"
2511) "    That roars so loud and thunders in the index?"
2512) "  Ham. Look here upon th's picture, and on this,"
2513) "    The counterfeit presentment of two brothers."
2514) "    See what a grace was seated on this brow;"
2515) "    Hyperion's curls; the front of Jove himself;"
2516) "    An eye like Mars, to threaten and command;"
2517) "    A station like the herald Mercury"
2518) "    New lighted on a heaven-kissing hill:"
2519) "    A combination and a form indeed"
2520) "    Where every god did seem to set his seal"
2521) "    To give the world assurance of a man."
2522) "    This was your husband. Look you now what follows."
2523) "    Here is your husband, like a mildew'd ear"
2524) "    Blasting his wholesome brother. Have you eyes?  "
2525) "    Could you on this fair mountain leave to feed,"
2526) "    And batten on this moor? Ha! have you eyes"
2527) "    You cannot call it love; for at your age"
2528) "    The heyday in the blood is tame, it's humble,"
2529) "    And waits upon the judgment; and what judgment"
2530) "    Would step from this to this? Sense sure you have,"
2531) "    Else could you not have motion; but sure that sense"
2532) "    Is apoplex'd; for madness would not err,"
2533) "    Nor sense to ecstacy was ne'er so thrall'd"
2534) "    But it reserv'd some quantity of choice"
2535) "    To serve in such a difference. What devil was't"
2536) "    That thus hath cozen'd you at hoodman-blind?"
2537) "    Eyes without feeling, feeling without sight,"
2538) "    Ears without hands or eyes, smelling sans all,"
2539) "    Or but a sickly part of one true sense"
2540) "    Could not so mope."
2541) "    O shame! where is thy blush? Rebellious hell,"
2542) "    If thou canst mutine in a matron's bones,"
2543) "    To flaming youth let virtue be as wax"
2544) "    And melt in her own fire. Proclaim no shame  "
2545) "    When the compulsive ardour gives the charge,"
2546) "    Since frost itself as actively doth burn,"
2547) "    And reason panders will."
2548) "  Queen. O Hamlet, speak no more!"
2549) "    Thou turn'st mine eyes into my very soul,"
2550) "    And there I see such black and grained spots"
2551) "    As will not leave their tinct."
2552) "  Ham. Nay, but to live"
2553) "    In the rank sweat of an enseamed bed,"
2554) "    Stew'd in corruption, honeying and making love"
2555) "    Over the nasty sty!"
2556) "  Queen. O, speak to me no more!"
2557) "    These words like daggers enter in mine ears."
2558) "    No more, sweet Hamlet!"
2559) "  Ham. A murtherer and a villain!"
2560) "    A slave that is not twentieth part the tithe"
2561) "    Of your precedent lord; a vice of kings;"
2562) "    A cutpurse of the empire and the rule,"
2563) "    That from a shelf the precious diadem stole"
2564) "    And put it in his pocket!  "
2565) "  Queen. No more!"
2566) "                Enter the Ghost in his nightgown."
2567) "  Ham. A king of shreds and patches!-"
2568) "    Save me and hover o'er me with your wings,"
2569) "    You heavenly guards! What would your gracious figure?"
2570) "  Queen. Alas, he's mad!"
2571) "  Ham. Do you not come your tardy son to chide,"
2572) "    That, laps'd in time and passion, lets go by"
2573) "    Th' important acting of your dread command?"
2574) "    O, say!"
2575) "  Ghost. Do not forget. This visitation"
2576) "    Is but to whet thy almost blunted purpose."
2577) "    But look, amazement on thy mother sits."
2578) "    O, step between her and her fighting soul"
2579) "    Conceit in weakest bodies strongest works."
2580) "    Speak to her, Hamlet."
2581) "  Ham. How is it with you, lady?"
2582) "  Queen. Alas, how is't with you,  "
2583) "    That you do bend your eye on vacancy,"
2584) "    And with th' encorporal air do hold discourse?"
2585) "    Forth at your eyes your spirits wildly peep;"
2586) "    And, as the sleeping soldiers in th' alarm,"
2587) "    Your bedded hairs, like life in excrements,"
2588) "    Start up and stand an end. O gentle son,"
2589) "    Upon the beat and flame of thy distemper"
2590) "    Sprinkle cool patience! Whereon do you look?"
2591) "  Ham. On him, on him! Look you how pale he glares!"
2592) "    His form and cause conjoin'd, preaching to stones,"
2593) "    Would make them capable.- Do not look upon me,"
2594) "    Lest with this piteous action you convert"
2595) "    My stern effects. Then what I have to do"
2596) "    Will want true colour- tears perchance for blood."
2597) "  Queen. To whom do you speak this?"
2598) "  Ham. Do you see nothing there?"
2599) "  Queen. Nothing at all; yet all that is I see."
2600) "  Ham. Nor did you nothing hear?"
2601) "  Queen. No, nothing but ourselves."
2602) "  Ham. Why, look you there! Look how it steals away!  "
2603) "    My father, in his habit as he liv'd!"
2604) "    Look where he goes even now out at the portal!"
2605) "                                                     Exit Ghost."
2606) "  Queen. This is the very coinage of your brain."
2607) "    This bodiless creation ecstasy"
2608) "    Is very cunning in."
2609) "  Ham. Ecstasy?"
2610) "    My pulse as yours doth temperately keep time"
2611) "    And makes as healthful music. It is not madness"
2612) "    That I have utt'red. Bring me to the test,"
2613) "    And I the matter will reword; which madness"
2614) "    Would gambol from. Mother, for love of grace,"
2615) "    Lay not that flattering unction to your soul"
2616) "    That not your trespass but my madness speaks."
2617) "    It will but skin and film the ulcerous place,"
2618) "    Whiles rank corruption, mining all within,"
2619) "    Infects unseen. Confess yourself to heaven;"
2620) "    Repent what's past; avoid what is to come;"
2621) "    And do not spread the compost on the weeds"
2622) "    To make them ranker. Forgive me this my virtue;  "
2623) "    For in the fatness of these pursy times"
2624) "    Virtue itself of vice must pardon beg-"
2625) "    Yea, curb and woo for leave to do him good."
2626) "  Queen. O Hamlet, thou hast cleft my heart in twain."
2627) "  Ham. O, throw away the worser part of it,"
2628) "    And live the purer with the other half,"
2629) "    Good night- but go not to my uncle's bed."
2630) "    Assume a virtue, if you have it not."
2631) "    That monster, custom, who all sense doth eat"
2632) "    Of habits evil, is angel yet in this,"
2633) "    That to the use of actions fair and good"
2634) "    He likewise gives a frock or livery,"
2635) "    That aptly is put on. Refrain to-night,"
2636) "    And that shall lend a kind of easiness"
2637) "    To the next abstinence; the next more easy;"
2638) "    For use almost can change the stamp of nature,"
2639) "    And either [master] the devil, or throw him out"
2640) "    With wondrous potency. Once more, good night;"
2641) "    And when you are desirous to be blest,"
2642) "    I'll blessing beg of you.- For this same lord,  "
2643) "    I do repent; but heaven hath pleas'd it so,"
2644) "    To punish me with this, and this with me,"
2645) "    That I must be their scourge and minister."
2646) "    I will bestow him, and will answer well"
2647) "    The death I gave him. So again, good night."
2648) "    I must be cruel, only to be kind;"
2649) "    Thus bad begins, and worse remains behind."
2650) "    One word more, good lady."
2651) "  Queen. What shall I do?"
2652) "  Ham. Not this, by no means, that I bid you do:"
2653) "    Let the bloat King tempt you again to bed;"
2654) "    Pinch wanton on your cheek; call you his mouse;"
2655) "    And let him, for a pair of reechy kisses,"
2656) "    Or paddling in your neck with his damn'd fingers,"
2657) "    Make you to ravel all this matter out,"
2658) "    That I essentially am not in madness,"
2659) "    But mad in craft. 'Twere good you let him know;"
2660) "    For who that's but a queen, fair, sober, wise,"
2661) "    Would from a paddock, from a bat, a gib"
2662) "    Such dear concernings hide? Who would do so?  "
2663) "    No, in despite of sense and secrecy,"
2664) "    Unpeg the basket on the house's top,"
2665) "    Let the birds fly, and like the famous ape,"
2666) "    To try conclusions, in the basket creep"
2667) "    And break your own neck down."
2668) "  Queen. Be thou assur'd, if words be made of breath,"
2669) "    And breath of life, I have no life to breathe"
2670) "    What thou hast said to me."
2671) "  Ham. I must to England; you know that?"
2672) "  Queen. Alack,"
2673) "    I had forgot! 'Tis so concluded on."
2674) "  Ham. There's letters seal'd; and my two schoolfellows,"
2675) "    Whom I will trust as I will adders fang'd,"
2676) "    They bear the mandate; they must sweep my way"
2677) "    And marshal me to knavery. Let it work;"
2678) "    For 'tis the sport to have the enginer"
2679) "    Hoist with his own petar; and 't shall go hard"
2680) "    But I will delve one yard below their mines"
2681) "    And blow them at the moon. O, 'tis most sweet"
2682) "    When in one line two crafts directly meet.  "
2683) "    This man shall set me packing."
2684) "    I'll lug the guts into the neighbour room.-"
2685) "    Mother, good night.- Indeed, this counsellor"
2686) "    Is now most still, most secret, and most grave,"
2687) "    Who was in life a foolish peating knave."
2688) "    Come, sir, to draw toward an end with you."
2689) "    Good night, mother."
2690) "                  [Exit the Queen. Then] Exit Hamlet, tugging in"
2691) "                                                       Polonius."
2692) "ACT IV. Scene I."
2693) "Elsinore. A room in the Castle."
2694) "Enter King and Queen, with Rosencrantz and Guildenstern."
2695) "  King. There's matter in these sighs. These profound heaves"
2696) "    You must translate; 'tis fit we understand them."
2697) "    Where is your son?"
2698) "  Queen. Bestow this place on us a little while."
2699) "                          [Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.]"
2700) "    Ah, mine own lord, what have I seen to-night!"
2701) "  King. What, Gertrude? How does Hamlet?"
2702) "  Queen. Mad as the sea and wind when both contend"
2703) "    Which is the mightier. In his lawless fit"
2704) "    Behind the arras hearing something stir,"
2705) "    Whips out his rapier, cries 'A rat, a rat!'"
2706) "    And in this brainish apprehension kills"
2707) "    The unseen good old man."
2708) "  King. O heavy deed!"
2709) "    It had been so with us, had we been there."
2710) "    His liberty is full of threats to all-"
2711) "    To you yourself, to us, to every one.  "
2712) "    Alas, how shall this bloody deed be answer'd?"
2713) "    It will be laid to us, whose providence"
2714) "    Should have kept short, restrain'd, and out of haunt"
2715) "    This mad young man. But so much was our love"
2716) "    We would not understand what was most fit,"
2717) "    But, like the owner of a foul disease,"
2718) "    To keep it from divulging, let it feed"
2719) "    Even on the pith of life. Where is he gone?"
2720) "  Queen. To draw apart the body he hath kill'd;"
2721) "    O'er whom his very madness, like some ore"
2722) "    Among a mineral of metals base,"
2723) "    Shows itself pure. He weeps for what is done."
2724) "  King. O Gertrude, come away!"
2725) "    The sun no sooner shall the mountains touch"
2726) "    But we will ship him hence; and this vile deed"
2727) "    We must with all our majesty and skill"
2728) "    Both countenance and excuse. Ho, Guildenstern!"
2729) "             Enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern."
2730) "  "
2731) "    Friends both, go join you with some further aid."
2732) "    Hamlet in madness hath Polonius slain,"
2733) "    And from his mother's closet hath he dragg'd him."
2734) "    Go seek him out; speak fair, and bring the body"
2735) "    Into the chapel. I pray you haste in this."
2736) "                          Exeunt [Rosencrantz and Guildenstern]."
2737) "    Come, Gertrude, we'll call up our wisest friends"
2738) "    And let them know both what we mean to do"
2739) "    And what's untimely done. [So haply slander-]"
2740) "    Whose whisper o'er the world's diameter,"
2741) "    As level as the cannon to his blank,"
2742) "    Transports his poisoned shot- may miss our name"
2743) "    And hit the woundless air.- O, come away!"
2744) "    My soul is full of discord and dismay."
2745) "                                                         Exeunt."

2747) "Elsinore. A passage in the Castle."
2748) "Enter Hamlet."
2749) "  Ham. Safely stow'd."
2750) "  Gentlemen. (within) Hamlet! Lord Hamlet!"
2751) "  Ham. But soft! What noise? Who calls on Hamlet? O, here they come."
2752) "               Enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern."
2753) "  Ros. What have you done, my lord, with the dead body?"
2754) "  Ham. Compounded it with dust, whereto 'tis kin."
2755) "  Ros. Tell us where 'tis, that we may take it thence"
2756) "    And bear it to the chapel."
2757) "  Ham. Do not believe it."
2758) "  Ros. Believe what?"
2759) "  Ham. That I can keep your counsel, and not mine own. Besides, to be"
2760) "    demanded of a sponge, what replication should be made by the son"
2761) "    of a king?"
2762) "  Ros. Take you me for a sponge, my lord?"
2763) "  Ham. Ay, sir; that soaks up the King's countenance, his rewards,  "
2764) "    his authorities. But such officers do the King best service in"
2765) "    the end. He keeps them, like an ape, in the corner of his jaw;"
2766) "    first mouth'd, to be last Swallowed. When he needs what you have"
2767) "    glean'd, it is but squeezing you and, sponge, you shall be dry"
2768) "    again."
2769) "  Ros. I understand you not, my lord."
2770) "  Ham. I am glad of it. A knavish speech sleeps in a foolish ear."
2771) "  Ros. My lord, you must tell us where the body is and go with us to"
2772) "    the King."
2773) "  Ham. The body is with the King, but the King is not with the body."
2774) "    The King is a thing-"
2775) "  Guil. A thing, my lord?"
2776) "  Ham. Of nothing. Bring me to him. Hide fox, and all after."
2777) "                                                         Exeunt."
2778) "Scene III."
2779) "Elsinore. A room in the Castle."
2780) "Enter King."
2781) "  King. I have sent to seek him and to find the body."
2782) "    How dangerous is it that this man goes loose!"
2783) "    Yet must not we put the strong law on him."
2784) "    He's lov'd of the distracted multitude,"
2785) "    Who like not in their judgment, but their eyes;"
2786) "    And where 'tis so, th' offender's scourge is weigh'd,"
2787) "    But never the offence. To bear all smooth and even,"
2788) "    This sudden sending him away must seem"
2789) "    Deliberate pause. Diseases desperate grown"
2790) "    By desperate appliance are reliev'd,"
2791) "    Or not at all."
2792) "                    Enter Rosencrantz."
2793) "    How now O What hath befall'n?"
2794) "  Ros. Where the dead body is bestow'd, my lord,"
2795) "    We cannot get from him.  "
2796) "  King. But where is he?"
2797) "  Ros. Without, my lord; guarded, to know your pleasure."
2798) "  King. Bring him before us."
2799) "  Ros. Ho, Guildenstern! Bring in my lord."
2800) "        Enter Hamlet and Guildenstern [with Attendants]."
2801) "  King. Now, Hamlet, where's Polonius?"
2802) "  Ham. At supper."
2803) "  King. At supper? Where?"
2804) "  Ham. Not where he eats, but where he is eaten. A certain"
2805) "    convocation of politic worms are e'en at him. Your worm is your"
2806) "    only emperor for diet. We fat all creatures else to fat us, and"
2807) "    we fat ourselves for maggots. Your fat king and your lean beggar"
2808) "    is but variable service- two dishes, but to one table. That's the"
2809) "    end."
2810) "  King. Alas, alas!"
2811) "  Ham. A man may fish with the worm that hath eat of a king, and eat"
2812) "    of the fish that hath fed of that worm."
2813) "  King. What dost thou mean by this?  "
2814) "  Ham. Nothing but to show you how a king may go a progress through"
2815) "    the guts of a beggar."
2816) "  King. Where is Polonius?"
2817) "  Ham. In heaven. Send thither to see. If your messenger find him not"
2818) "    there, seek him i' th' other place yourself. But indeed, if you"
2819) "    find him not within this month, you shall nose him as you go up"

3195) "    slow of sail, we put on a compelled valour, and in the grapple I"
3196) "    boarded them. On the instant they got clear of our ship; so I"
3197) "    alone became their prisoner. They have dealt with me like thieves"
3198) "    of mercy; but they knew what they did: I am to do a good turn for"
3199) "    them. Let the King have the letters I have sent, and repair thou"

3223) "    Which may to you, perhaps, seein much unsinew'd,"
3224) "    But yet to me they are strong. The Queen his mother"
3225) "    Lives almost by his looks; and for myself,-"
3226) "    My virtue or my plague, be it either which,-"
3227) "    She's so conjunctive to my life and soul"
3228) "    That, as the star moves not but in his sphere,  "
3229) "    I could not but by her. The other motive"
3230) "    Why to a public count I might not go"
3231) "    Is the great love the general gender bear him,"
3232) "    Who, dipping all his faults in their affection,"

3234) "    Convert his gives to graces; so that my arrows,"
3235) "    Too slightly timber'd for so loud a wind,"
3236) "    Would have reverted to my bow again,"
3237) "    And not where I had aim'd them."
3238) "  Laer. And so have I a noble father lost;"

3241) "    Stood challenger on mount of all the age"

3243) "  King. Break not your sleeps for that. You must not think"
3244) "    That we are made of stuff so flat and dull"
3245) "    That we can let our beard be shook with danger,"
3246) "    And think it pastime. You shortly shall hear more."

3251) "  Mess. Letters, my lord, from Hamlet:"
3252) "    This to your Majesty; this to the Queen."
3253) "  King. From Hamlet? Who brought them?"
3254) "  Mess. Sailors, my lord, they say; I saw them not."
3255) "    They were given me by Claudio; he receiv'd them"
3256) "    Of him that brought them."
3257) "  King. Laertes, you shall hear them."
3258) "    Leave us."
3259) "                                                 Exit Messenger."

3263) "    occasion of my sudden and more strange return."
3264) "                                                     'HAMLET.'"
3265) "    What should this mean? Are all the rest come back?"
3266) "    Or is it some abuse, and no such thing?  "
3267) "  Laer. Know you the hand?"
3268) "  King. 'Tis Hamlet's character. 'Naked!'"
3269) "    And in a postscript here, he says 'alone.'"
3270) "    Can you advise me?"
3271) "  Laer. I am lost in it, my lord. But let him come!"
3272) "    It warms the very sickness in my heart"
3273) "    That I shall live and tell him to his teeth,"
3274) "    'Thus didest thou.'"
3275) "  King. If it be so, Laertes"
3276) "    (As how should it be so? how otherwise?),"
3277) "    Will you be rul'd by me?"
3278) "  Laer. Ay my lord,"
3279) "    So you will not o'errule me to a peace."
3280) "  King. To thine own peace. If he be now return'd"
3281) "    As checking at his voyage, and that he means"
3282) "    No more to undertake it, I will work him"
3283) "    To exploit now ripe in my device,"
3284) "    Under the which he shall not choose but fall;"
3285) "    And for his death no wind"
3286) "    But even his mother shall uncharge the practice  "
3287) "    And call it accident."
3288) "  Laer. My lord, I will be rul'd;"
3289) "    The rather, if you could devise it so"
3290) "    That I might be the organ."
3291) "  King. It falls right."
3292) "    You have been talk'd of since your travel much,"
3293) "    And that in Hamlet's hearing, for a quality"
3294) "    Wherein they say you shine, Your sun of parts"
3295) "    Did not together pluck such envy from him"
3296) "    As did that one; and that, in my regard,"
3297) "    Of the unworthiest siege."
3298) "  Laer. What part is that, my lord?"
3299) "  King. A very riband in the cap of youth-"
3300) "    Yet needfull too; for youth no less becomes"
3301) "    The light and careless livery that it wears"
3302) "    Thin settled age his sables and his weeds,"
3303) "    Importing health and graveness. Two months since"
3304) "    Here was a gentleman of Normandy."
3305) "    I have seen myself, and serv'd against, the French,"
3306) "    And they can well on horseback; but this gallant  "
3307) "    Had witchcraft in't. He grew unto his seat,"
3308) "    And to such wondrous doing brought his horse"
3309) "    As had he been incorps'd and demi-natur'd"
3310) "    With the brave beast. So far he topp'd my thought"
3311) "    That I, in forgery of shapes and tricks,"
3312) "    Come short of what he did."
3313) "  Laer. A Norman was't?"
3314) "  King. A Norman."
3315) "  Laer. Upon my life, Lamound."
3316) "  King. The very same."
3317) "  Laer. I know him well. He is the broach indeed"
3318) "    And gem of all the nation."
3319) "  King. He made confession of you;"
3320) "    And gave you such a masterly report"
3321) "    For art and exercise in your defence,"
3322) "    And for your rapier most especially,"
3323) "    That he cried out 'twould be a sight indeed"
3324) "    If one could match you. The scrimers of their nation"
3325) "    He swore had neither motion, guard, nor eye,"
3326) "    If you oppos'd them. Sir, this report of his  "
3327) "    Did Hamlet so envenom with his envy"
3328) "    That he could nothing do but wish and beg"
3329) "    Your sudden coming o'er to play with you."
3330) "    Now, out of this-"
3331) "  Laer. What out of this, my lord?"
3332) "  King. Laertes, was your father dear to you?"
3333) "    Or are you like the painting of a sorrow,"
3334) "    A face without a heart,'"
3335) "  Laer. Why ask you this?"
3336) "  King. Not that I think you did not love your father;"
3337) "    But that I know love is begun by time,"
3338) "    And that I see, in passages of proof,"
3339) "    Time qualifies the spark and fire of it."
3340) "    There lives within the very flame of love"
3341) "    A kind of wick or snuff that will abate it;"
3342) "    And nothing is at a like goodness still;"
3343) "    For goodness, growing to a plurisy,"
3344) "    Dies in his own too-much. That we would do,"
3345) "    We should do when we would; for this 'would' changes,"
3346) "    And hath abatements and delays as many  "
3347) "    As there are tongues, are hands, are accidents;"
3348) "    And then this 'should' is like a spendthrift sigh,"
3349) "    That hurts by easing. But to the quick o' th' ulcer!"
3350) "    Hamlet comes back. What would you undertake"
3351) "    To show yourself your father's son in deed"
3352) "    More than in words?"
3353) "  Laer. To cut his throat i' th' church!"
3354) "  King. No place indeed should murther sanctuarize;"
3355) "    Revenge should have no bounds. But, good Laertes,"
3356) "    Will you do this? Keep close within your chamber."
3357) "    Will return'd shall know you are come home."
3358) "    We'll put on those shall praise your excellence"
3359) "    And set a double varnish on the fame"
3360) "    The Frenchman gave you; bring you in fine together"
3361) "    And wager on your heads. He, being remiss,"
3362) "    Most generous, and free from all contriving,"
3363) "    Will not peruse the foils; so that with ease,"
3364) "    Or with a little shuffling, you may choose"
3365) "    A sword unbated, and, in a pass of practice,"
3366) "    Requite him for your father.  "
3367) "  Laer. I will do't!"
3368) "    And for that purpose I'll anoint my sword."
3369) "    I bought an unction of a mountebank,"
3370) "    So mortal that, but dip a knife in it,"
3371) "    Where it draws blood no cataplasm so rare,"
3372) "    Collected from all simples that have virtue"
3373) "    Under the moon, can save the thing from death"
3374) "    This is but scratch'd withal. I'll touch my point"
3375) "    With this contagion, that, if I gall him slightly,"
3376) "    It may be death."
3377) "  King. Let's further think of this,"
3378) "    Weigh what convenience both of time and means"
3379) "    May fit us to our shape. If this should fall,"
3380) "    And that our drift look through our bad performance."
3381) "    'Twere better not assay'd. Therefore this project"
3382) "    Should have a back or second, that might hold"
3383) "    If this did blast in proof. Soft! let me see."
3384) "    We'll make a solemn wager on your cunnings-"
3385) "    I ha't!"
3386) "    When in your motion you are hot and dry-  "
3387) "    As make your bouts more violent to that end-"
3388) "    And that he calls for drink, I'll have prepar'd him"
3389) "    A chalice for the nonce; whereon but sipping,"
3390) "    If he by chance escape your venom'd stuck,"
3391) "    Our purpose may hold there.- But stay, what noise,"
3392) "                           Enter Queen."
3393) "    How now, sweet queen?"
3394) "  Queen. One woe doth tread upon another's heel,"
3395) "    So fast they follow. Your sister's drown'd, Laertes."
3396) "  Laer. Drown'd! O, where?"
3397) "  Queen. There is a willow grows aslant a brook,"
3398) "    That shows his hoar leaves in the glassy stream."
3399) "    There with fantastic garlands did she come"
3400) "    Of crowflowers, nettles, daisies, and long purples,"
3401) "    That liberal shepherds give a grosser name,"
3402) "    But our cold maids do dead men's fingers call them."
3403) "    There on the pendant boughs her coronet weeds"
3404) "    Clamb'ring to hang, an envious sliver broke,  "
3405) "    When down her weedy trophies and herself"
3406) "    Fell in the weeping brook. Her clothes spread wide"
3407) "    And, mermaid-like, awhile they bore her up;"
3408) "    Which time she chaunted snatches of old tunes,"
3409) "    As one incapable of her own distress,"
3410) "    Or like a creature native and indued"
3411) "    Unto that element; but long it could not be"
3412) "    Till that her garments, heavy with their drink,"
3413) "    Pull'd the poor wretch from her melodious lay"
3414) "    To muddy death."
3415) "  Laer. Alas, then she is drown'd?"
3416) "  Queen. Drown'd, drown'd."
3417) "  Laer. Too much of water hast thou, poor Ophelia,"
3418) "    And therefore I forbid my tears; but yet"
3419) "    It is our trick; nature her custom holds,"
3420) "    Let shame say what it will. When these are gone,"
3421) "    The woman will be out. Adieu, my lord."
3422) "    I have a speech of fire, that fain would blaze"
3423) "    But that this folly douts it.                          Exit."
3424) "  King. Let's follow, Gertrude.  "
3425) "    How much I had to do to calm his rage I"
3426) "    Now fear I this will give it start again;"
3427) "    Therefore let's follow."
3428) "                                                         Exeunt."

3432) "  Clown. Is she to be buried in Christian burial when she wilfully"
3433) "    seeks her own salvation?"
3434) "  Other. I tell thee she is; therefore make her grave straight."
3435) "    The crowner hath sate on her, and finds it Christian burial."
3436) "  Clown. How can that be, unless she drown'd herself in her own"
3437) "    defence?"
3438) "  Other. Why, 'tis found so."
3439) "  Clown. It must be se offendendo; it cannot be else. For here lies"
3440) "    the point: if I drown myself wittingly, it argues an act; and an"
3441) "    act hath three branches-it is to act, to do, and to perform;"
3442) "    argal, she drown'd herself wittingly."
3443) "  Other. Nay, but hear you, Goodman Delver!"
3444) "  Clown. Give me leave. Here lies the water; good. Here stands the"
3445) "    man; good. If the man go to this water and drown himself, it is,"
3446) "    will he nill he, he goes- mark you that. But if the water come to"
3447) "    him and drown him, he drowns not himself. Argal, he that is not"
3448) "    guilty of his own death shortens not his own life.  "
3449) "  Other. But is this law?"
3450) "  Clown. Ay, marry, is't- crowner's quest law."
3451) "  Other. Will you ha' the truth an't? If this had not been a"
3452) "    gentlewoman, she should have been buried out o' Christian burial."
3453) "  Clown. Why, there thou say'st! And the more pity that great folk"
3454) "    should have count'nance in this world to drown or hang themselves"
3455) "    more than their even-Christen. Come, my spade! There is no"
3456) "    ancient gentlemen but gard'ners, ditchers, and grave-makers. They"
3457) "    hold up Adam's profession."
3458) "  Other. Was he a gentleman?"
3459) "  Clown. 'A was the first that ever bore arms."
3460) "  Other. Why, he had none."
3461) "  Clown. What, art a heathen? How dost thou understand the Scripture?"
3462) "    The Scripture says Adam digg'd. Could he dig without arms? I'll"
3463) "    put another question to thee. If thou answerest me not to the"
3464) "    purpose, confess thyself-"
3465) "  Other. Go to!"
3466) "  Clown. What is he that builds stronger than either the mason, the"
3467) "    shipwright, or the carpenter?"
3468) "  Other. The gallows-maker; for that frame outlives a thousand  "
3469) "    tenants."
3470) "  Clown. I like thy wit well, in good faith. The gallows does well."
3471) "    But how does it well? It does well to those that do ill. Now,"
3472) "    thou dost ill to say the gallows is built stronger than the"
3473) "    church. Argal, the gallows may do well to thee. To't again, come!"
3474) "  Other. Who builds stronger than a mason, a shipwright, or a"
3475) "    carpenter?"
3476) "  Clown. Ay, tell me that, and unyoke."
3477) "  Other. Marry, now I can tell!"
3478) "  Clown. To't."
3479) "  Other. Mass, I cannot tell."
3480) "                 Enter Hamlet and Horatio afar off."
3481) "  Clown. Cudgel thy brains no more about it, for your dull ass will"
3482) "    not mend his pace with beating; and when you are ask'd this"
3483) "    question next, say 'a grave-maker.' The houses he makes lasts"

3503) "  "
3504) "  Ham. That skull had a tongue in it, and could sing once. How the"
3505) "    knave jowls it to the ground,as if 'twere Cain's jawbone, that"
3506) "    did the first murther! This might be the pate of a Politician,"
3507) "    which this ass now o'erreaches; one that would circumvent God,"
3508) "    might it not?"
3509) "  Hor. It might, my lord."
3510) "  Ham. Or of a courtier, which could say 'Good morrow, sweet lord!"
3511) "    How dost thou, good lord?' This might be my Lord Such-a-one, that"
3512) "    prais'd my Lord Such-a-one's horse when he meant to beg it- might"
3513) "    it not?"
3514) "  Hor. Ay, my lord."
3515) "  Ham. Why, e'en so! and now my Lady Worm's, chapless, and knock'd"
3516) "    about the mazzard with a sexton's spade. Here's fine revolution,"
3517) "    and we had the trick to see't. Did these bones cost no more the"
3518) "    breeding but to play at loggets with 'em? Mine ache to think"
3519) "    on't."
3520) "  Clown. (Sings)"
3521) "         A pickaxe and a spade, a spade,"
3522) "           For and a shrouding sheet;"
3523) "         O, a Pit of clay for to be made  "
3524) "           For such a guest is meet."
3525) "                                      Throws up [another skull]."
3526) "  Ham. There's another. Why may not that be the skull of a lawyer?"
3527) "    Where be his quiddits now, his quillets, his cases, his tenures,"
3528) "    and his tricks? Why does he suffer this rude knave now to knock"
3529) "    him about the sconce with a dirty shovel, and will not tell him"
3530) "    of his action of battery? Hum! This fellow might be in's time a"
3531) "    great buyer of land, with his statutes, his recognizances, his"
3532) "    fines, his double vouchers, his recoveries. Is this the fine of"
3533) "    his fines, and the recovery of his recoveries, to have his fine"
3534) "    pate full of fine dirt? Will his vouchers vouch him no more of"
3535) "    his purchases, and double ones too, than the length and breadth"
3536) "    of a pair of indentures? The very conveyances of his lands will"
3537) "    scarcely lie in this box; and must th' inheritor himself have no"
3538) "    more, ha?"
3539) "  Hor. Not a jot more, my lord."
3540) "  Ham. Is not parchment made of sheepskins?"
3541) "  Hor. Ay, my lord, And of calveskins too."
3542) "  Ham. They are sheep and calves which seek out assurance in that. I  "
3543) "    will speak to this fellow. Whose grave's this, sirrah?"
3544) "  Clown. Mine, sir."
3545) "    [Sings] O, a pit of clay for to be made"
3546) "              For such a guest is meet."
3547) "  Ham. I think it be thine indeed, for thou liest in't."
3548) "  Clown. You lie out on't, sir, and therefore 'tis not yours."
3549) "    For my part, I do not lie in't, yet it is mine."
3550) "  Ham. Thou dost lie in't, to be in't and say it is thine. 'Tis for"
3551) "    the dead, not for the quick; therefore thou liest."
3552) "  Clown. 'Tis a quick lie, sir; 'twill away again from me to you."
3553) "  Ham. What man dost thou dig it for?"
3554) "  Clown. For no man, sir."
3555) "  Ham. What woman then?"
3556) "  Clown. For none neither."
3557) "  Ham. Who is to be buried in't?"
3558) "  Clown. One that was a woman, sir; but, rest her soul, she's dead."
3559) "  Ham. How absolute the knave is! We must speak by the card, or"
3560) "    equivocation will undo us. By the Lord, Horatio, this three years"
3561) "    I have taken note of it, the age is grown so picked that the toe  "
3562) "    of the peasant comes so near the heel of the courtier he galls"
3563) "    his kibe.- How long hast thou been a grave-maker?"
3564) "  Clown. Of all the days i' th' year, I came to't that day that our"
3565) "    last king Hamlet overcame Fortinbras."
3566) "  Ham. How long is that since?"
3567) "  Clown. Cannot you tell that? Every fool can tell that. It was the"
3568) "    very day that young Hamlet was born- he that is mad, and sent"
3569) "    into England."
3570) "  Ham. Ay, marry, why was be sent into England?"
3571) "  Clown. Why, because 'a was mad. 'A shall recover his wits there;"
3572) "    or, if 'a do not, 'tis no great matter there."
3573) "  Ham. Why?"
3574) "  Clown. 'Twill not he seen in him there. There the men are as mad as"
3575) "    he."
3576) "  Ham. How came he mad?"
3577) "  Clown. Very strangely, they say."
3578) "  Ham. How strangely?"
3579) "  Clown. Faith, e'en with losing his wits."
3580) "  Ham. Upon what ground?"
3581) "  Clown. Why, here in Denmark. I have been sexton here, man and boy  "
3582) "    thirty years."
3583) "  Ham. How long will a man lie i' th' earth ere he rot?"
3584) "  Clown. Faith, if 'a be not rotten before 'a die (as we have many"
3585) "    pocky corses now-a-days that will scarce hold the laying in, I"
3586) "    will last you some eight year or nine year. A tanner will last"
3587) "    you nine year."
3588) "  Ham. Why he more than another?"
3589) "  Clown. Why, sir, his hide is so tann'd with his trade that 'a will"
3590) "    keep out water a great while; and your water is a sore decayer of"
3591) "    your whoreson dead body. Here's a skull now. This skull hath lien"
3592) "    you i' th' earth three-and-twenty years."
3593) "  Ham. Whose was it?"
3594) "  Clown. A whoreson, mad fellow's it was. Whose do you think it was?"
3595) "  Ham. Nay, I know not."
3596) "  Clown. A pestilence on him for a mad rogue! 'A pour'd a flagon of"
3597) "    Rhenish on my head once. This same skull, sir, was Yorick's"
3598) "    skull, the King's jester."
3599) "  Ham. This?"
3600) "  Clown. E'en that."
3601) "  Ham. Let me see. [Takes the skull.] Alas, poor Yorick! I knew him,  "
3602) "    Horatio. A fellow of infinite jest, of most excellent fancy. He"
3603) "    hath borne me on his back a thousand tunes. And now how abhorred"
3604) "    in my imagination it is! My gorge rises at it. Here hung those"
3605) "    lips that I have kiss'd I know not how oft. Where be your gibes"
3606) "    now? your gambols? your songs? your flashes of merriment that"
3607) "    were wont to set the table on a roar? Not one now, to mock your"
3608) "    own grinning? Quite chap- fall'n? Now get you to my lady's"
3609) "    chamber, and tell her, let her paint an inch thick, to this"
3610) "    favour she must come. Make her laugh at that. Prithee, Horatio,"
3611) "    tell me one thing."
3612) "  Hor. What's that, my lord?"
3613) "  Ham. Dost thou think Alexander look'd o' this fashion i' th' earth?"
3614) "  Hor. E'en so."
3615) "  Ham. And smelt so? Pah!"
3616) "                                          [Puts down the skull.]"
3617) "  Hor. E'en so, my lord."
3618) "  Ham. To what base uses we may return, Horatio! Why may not"
3619) "    imagination trace the noble dust of Alexander till he find it"
3620) "    stopping a bunghole?"
3621) "  Hor. 'Twere to consider too curiously, to consider so.  "
3622) "  Ham. No, faith, not a jot; but to follow him thither with modesty"
3623) "    enough, and likelihood to lead it; as thus: Alexander died,"
3624) "    Alexander was buried, Alexander returneth into dust; the dust is"
3625) "    earth; of earth we make loam; and why of that loam (whereto he"
3626) "    was converted) might they not stop a beer barrel?"
3627) "    Imperious Caesar, dead and turn'd to clay,"
3628) "    Might stop a hole to keep the wind away."
3629) "    O, that that earth which kept the world in awe"
3630) "    Should patch a wall t' expel the winter's flaw!"
3631) "    But soft! but soft! aside! Here comes the King-"
3632) "    Enter [priests with] a coffin [in funeral procession], King,"
3633) "             Queen, Laertes, with Lords attendant.]"
3634) "    The Queen, the courtiers. Who is this they follow?"
3635) "    And with such maimed rites? This doth betoken"
3636) "    The corse they follow did with desp'rate hand"
3637) "    Fordo it own life. 'Twas of some estate."
3638) "    Couch we awhile, and mark."
3639) "                                         [Retires with Horatio.]  "
3640) "  Laer. What ceremony else?"
3641) "  Ham. That is Laertes,"
3642) "    A very noble youth. Mark."
3643) "  Laer. What ceremony else?"
3644) "  Priest. Her obsequies have been as far enlarg'd"
3645) "    As we have warranty. Her death was doubtful;"
3646) "    And, but that great command o'ersways the order,"
3647) "    She should in ground unsanctified have lodg'd"
3648) "    Till the last trumpet. For charitable prayers,"
3649) "    Shards, flints, and pebbles should be thrown on her."
3650) "    Yet here she is allow'd her virgin crants,"
3651) "    Her maiden strewments, and the bringing home"
3652) "    Of bell and burial."
3653) "  Laer. Must there no more be done?"
3654) "  Priest. No more be done."
3655) "    We should profane the service of the dead"
3656) "    To sing a requiem and such rest to her"
3657) "    As to peace-parted souls."
3658) "  Laer. Lay her i' th' earth;"
3659) "    And from her fair and unpolluted flesh  "
3660) "    May violets spring! I tell thee, churlish priest,"
3661) "    A minist'ring angel shall my sister be"
3662) "    When thou liest howling."
3663) "  Ham. What, the fair Ophelia?"
3664) "  Queen. Sweets to the sweet! Farewell."
3665) "                                             [Scatters flowers.]"
3666) "    I hop'd thou shouldst have been my Hamlet's wife;"
3667) "    I thought thy bride-bed to have deck'd, sweet maid,"
3668) "    And not have strew'd thy grave."
3669) "  Laer. O, treble woe"
3670) "    Fall ten times treble on that cursed head"
3671) "    Whose wicked deed thy most ingenious sense"
3672) "    Depriv'd thee of! Hold off the earth awhile,"
3673) "    Till I have caught her once more in mine arms."
3674) "                                             Leaps in the grave."
3675) "    Now pile your dust upon the quick and dead"
3676) "    Till of this flat a mountain you have made"
3677) "    T' o'ertop old Pelion or the skyish head"
3678) "    Of blue Olympus."
3679) "  Ham. [comes forward] What is he whose grief  "
3680) "    Bears such an emphasis? whose phrase of sorrow"
3681) "    Conjures the wand'ring stars, and makes them stand"
3682) "    Like wonder-wounded hearers? This is I,"
3683) "    Hamlet the Dane.                    [Leaps in after Laertes."
3684) "  Laer. The devil take thy soul!"
3685) "                                            [Grapples with him]."
3686) "  Ham. Thou pray'st not well."
3687) "    I prithee take thy fingers from my throat;"
3688) "    For, though I am not splenitive and rash,"
3689) "    Yet have I in me something dangerous,"
3690) "    Which let thy wisdom fear. Hold off thy hand!"
3691) "  King. Pluck thein asunder."
3692) "  Queen. Hamlet, Hamlet!"
3693) "  All. Gentlemen!"
3694) "  Hor. Good my lord, be quiet."
3695) "             [The Attendants part them, and they come out of the"
3696) "                                                         grave.]"
3697) "  Ham. Why, I will fight with him upon this theme"
3698) "    Until my eyelids will no longer wag."
3699) "  Queen. O my son, what theme?  "
3700) "  Ham. I lov'd Ophelia. Forty thousand brothers"
3701) "    Could not (with all their quantity of love)"
3702) "    Make up my sum. What wilt thou do for her?"
3703) "  King. O, he is mad, Laertes."
3704) "  Queen. For love of God, forbear him!"
3705) "  Ham. 'Swounds, show me what thou't do."
3706) "    Woo't weep? woo't fight? woo't fast? woo't tear thyself?"
3707) "    Woo't drink up esill? eat a crocodile?"
3708) "    I'll do't. Dost thou come here to whine?"
3709) "    To outface me with leaping in her grave?"
3710) "    Be buried quick with her, and so will I."
3711) "    And if thou prate of mountains, let them throw"
3712) "    Millions of acres on us, till our ground,"
3713) "    Singeing his pate against the burning zone,"
3714) "    Make Ossa like a wart! Nay, an thou'lt mouth,"
3715) "    I'll rant as well as thou."
3716) "  Queen. This is mere madness;"
3717) "    And thus a while the fit will work on him."
3718) "    Anon, as patient as the female dove"
3719) "    When that her golden couplets are disclos'd,  "
3720) "    His silence will sit drooping."
3721) "  Ham. Hear you, sir!"
3722) "    What is the reason that you use me thus?"
3723) "    I lov'd you ever. But it is no matter."
3724) "    Let Hercules himself do what he may,"
3725) "    The cat will mew, and dog will have his day."
3726) "Exit."
3727) "  King. I pray thee, good Horatio, wait upon him."
3728) "                                                   Exit Horatio."
3729) "    [To Laertes] Strengthen your patience in our last night's speech."
3730) "    We'll put the matter to the present push.-"
3731) "    Good Gertrude, set some watch over your son.-"
3732) "    This grave shall have a living monument."
3733) "    An hour of quiet shortly shall we see;"
3734) "    Till then in patience our proceeding be."
3735) "                                                         Exeunt."
3736) "Scene II."
3737) "Elsinore. A hall in the Castle."
3738) "Enter Hamlet and Horatio."
3739) "  Ham. So much for this, sir; now shall you see the other."
3740) "    You do remember all the circumstance?"
3741) "  Hor. Remember it, my lord!"
3742) "  Ham. Sir, in my heart there was a kind of fighting"
3743) "    That would not let me sleep. Methought I lay"
3744) "    Worse than the mutinies in the bilboes. Rashly-"
3745) "    And prais'd be rashness for it; let us know,"
3746) "    Our indiscretion sometime serves us well"
3747) "    When our deep plots do pall; and that should learn us"
3748) "    There's a divinity that shapes our ends,"
3749) "    Rough-hew them how we will-"
3750) "  Hor. That is most certain."
3751) "  Ham. Up from my cabin,"
3752) "    My sea-gown scarf'd about me, in the dark"
3753) "    Grop'd I to find out them; had my desire,"
3754) "    Finger'd their packet, and in fine withdrew"
3755) "    To mine own room again; making so bold  "
3756) "    (My fears forgetting manners) to unseal"
3757) "    Their grand commission; where I found, Horatio"
3758) "    (O royal knavery!), an exact command,"
3759) "    Larded with many several sorts of reasons,"
3760) "    Importing Denmark's health, and England's too,"
3761) "    With, hoo! such bugs and goblins in my life-"
3762) "    That, on the supervise, no leisure bated,"
3763) "    No, not to stay the finding of the axe,"
3764) "    My head should be struck off."
3765) "  Hor. Is't possible?"
3766) "  Ham. Here's the commission; read it at more leisure."
3767) "    But wilt thou bear me how I did proceed?"
3768) "  Hor. I beseech you."
3769) "  Ham. Being thus benetted round with villanies,"
3770) "    Or I could make a prologue to my brains,"
3771) "    They had begun the play. I sat me down;"
3772) "    Devis'd a new commission; wrote it fair."
3773) "    I once did hold it, as our statists do,"
3774) "    A baseness to write fair, and labour'd much"
3775) "    How to forget that learning; but, sir, now  "
3776) "    It did me yeoman's service. Wilt thou know"
3777) "    Th' effect of what I wrote?"
3778) "  Hor. Ay, good my lord."
3779) "  Ham. An earnest conjuration from the King,"
3780) "    As England was his faithful tributary,"
3781) "    As love between them like the palm might flourish,"
3782) "    As peace should still her wheaten garland wear"
3783) "    And stand a comma 'tween their amities,"
3784) "    And many such-like as's of great charge,"
3785) "    That, on the view and knowing of these contents,"
3786) "    Without debatement further, more or less,"
3787) "    He should the bearers put to sudden death,"
3788) "    Not shriving time allow'd."
3789) "  Hor. How was this seal'd?"
3790) "  Ham. Why, even in that was heaven ordinant."
3791) "    I had my father's signet in my purse,"
3792) "    which was the model of that Danish seal;"
3793) "    Folded the writ up in the form of th' other,"
3794) "    Subscrib'd it, gave't th' impression, plac'd it safely,"
3795) "    The changeling never known. Now, the next day  "
3796) "    Was our sea-fight; and what to this was sequent"
3797) "    Thou know'st already."
3798) "  Hor. So Guildenstern and Rosencrantz go to't."
3799) "  Ham. Why, man, they did make love to this employment!"
3800) "    They are not near my conscience; their defeat"
3801) "    Does by their own insinuation grow."
3802) "    'Tis dangerous when the baser nature comes"
3803) "    Between the pass and fell incensed points"
3804) "    Of mighty opposites."
3805) "  Hor. Why, what a king is this!"
3806) "  Ham. Does it not, thinks't thee, stand me now upon-"
3807) "    He that hath kill'd my king, and whor'd my mother;"
3808) "    Popp'd in between th' election and my hopes;"
3809) "    Thrown out his angle for my Proper life,"
3810) "    And with such coz'nage- is't not perfect conscience"
3811) "    To quit him with this arm? And is't not to be damn'd"
3812) "    To let this canker of our nature come"
3813) "    In further evil?"
3814) "  Hor. It must be shortly known to him from England"
3815) "    What is the issue of the business there.  "
3816) "  Ham. It will be short; the interim is mine,"
3817) "    And a man's life is no more than to say 'one.'"
3818) "    But I am very sorry, good Horatio,"
3819) "    That to Laertes I forgot myself,"
3820) "    For by the image of my cause I see"
3821) "    The portraiture of his. I'll court his favours."
3822) "    But sure the bravery of his grief did put me"
3823) "    Into a tow'ring passion."
3824) "  Hor. Peace! Who comes here?"
3825) "                 Enter young Osric, a courtier."
3826) "  Osr. Your lordship is right welcome back to Denmark."
3827) "  Ham. I humbly thank you, sir. [Aside to Horatio] Dost know this"
3828) "    waterfly?"
3829) "  Hor. [aside to Hamlet] No, my good lord."
3830) "  Ham. [aside to Horatio] Thy state is the more gracious; for 'tis a"
3831) "    vice to know him. He hath much land, and fertile. Let a beast be"
3832) "    lord of beasts, and his crib shall stand at the king's mess. 'Tis"
3833) "    a chough; but, as I say, spacious in the possession of dirt.  "
3834) "  Osr. Sweet lord, if your lordship were at leisure, I should impart"
3835) "    a thing to you from his Majesty."
3836) "  Ham. I will receive it, sir, with all diligence of spirit. Put your"
3837) "    bonnet to his right use. 'Tis for the head."
3838) "  Osr. I thank your lordship, it is very hot."
3839) "  Ham. No, believe me, 'tis very cold; the wind is northerly."
3840) "  Osr. It is indifferent cold, my lord, indeed."
3841) "  Ham. But yet methinks it is very sultry and hot for my complexion."
3842) "  Osr. Exceedingly, my lord; it is very sultry, as 'twere- I cannot"
3843) "    tell how. But, my lord, his Majesty bade me signify to you that"
3844) "    he has laid a great wager on your head. Sir, this is the matter-"
3845) "  Ham. I beseech you remember."
3846) "                           [Hamlet moves him to put on his hat.]"
3847) "  Osr. Nay, good my lord; for mine ease, in good faith. Sir, here is"
3848) "    newly come to court Laertes; believe me, an absolute gentleman,"
3849) "    full of most excellent differences, of very soft society and"
3850) "    great showing. Indeed, to speak feelingly of him, he is the card"
3851) "    or calendar of gentry; for you shall find in him the continent of"
3852) "    what part a gentleman would see."
3853) "  Ham. Sir, his definement suffers no perdition in you; though, I  "
3854) "    know, to divide him inventorially would dozy th' arithmetic of"
3855) "    memory, and yet but yaw neither in respect of his quick sail."
3856) "    But, in the verity of extolment, I take him to be a soul of great"
3857) "    article, and his infusion of such dearth and rareness as, to make"
3858) "    true diction of him, his semblable is his mirror, and who else"
3859) "    would trace him, his umbrage, nothing more."
3860) "  Osr. Your lordship speaks most infallibly of him."
3861) "  Ham. The concernancy, sir? Why do we wrap the gentleman in our more"
3862) "    rawer breath"
3863) "  Osr. Sir?"
3864) "  Hor [aside to Hamlet] Is't not possible to understand in another"
3865) "    tongue? You will do't, sir, really."
3866) "  Ham. What imports the nomination of this gentleman"
3867) "  Osr. Of Laertes?"
3868) "  Hor. [aside] His purse is empty already. All's golden words are"
3869) "    spent."
3870) "  Ham. Of him, sir."
3871) "  Osr. I know you are not ignorant-"
3872) "  Ham. I would you did, sir; yet, in faith, if you did, it would not"
3873) "    much approve me. Well, sir?  "
3874) "  Osr. You are not ignorant of what excellence Laertes is-"
3875) "  Ham. I dare not confess that, lest I should compare with him in"
3876) "    excellence; but to know a man well were to know himself."
3877) "  Osr. I mean, sir, for his weapon; but in the imputation laid on him"
3878) "    by them, in his meed he's unfellowed."
3879) "  Ham. What's his weapon?"
3880) "  Osr. Rapier and dagger."
3881) "  Ham. That's two of his weapons- but well."
3882) "  Osr. The King, sir, hath wager'd with him six Barbary horses;"
3883) "    against the which he has impon'd, as I take it, six French"
3884) "    rapiers and poniards, with their assigns, as girdle, hangers, and"
3885) "    so. Three of the carriages, in faith, are very dear to fancy,"
3886) "    very responsive to the hilts, most delicate carriages, and of"
3887) "    very liberal conceit."
3888) "  Ham. What call you the carriages?"
3889) "  Hor. [aside to Hamlet] I knew you must be edified by the margent"
3890) "    ere you had done."
3891) "  Osr. The carriages, sir, are the hangers."
3892) "  Ham. The phrase would be more germane to the matter if we could"
3893) "    carry cannon by our sides. I would it might be hangers till then.  "
3894) "    But on! Six Barbary horses against six French swords, their"
3895) "    assigns, and three liberal-conceited carriages: that's the French"
3896) "    bet against the Danish. Why is this all impon'd, as you call it?"
3897) "  Osr. The King, sir, hath laid that, in a dozen passes between"
3898) "    yourself and him, he shall not exceed you three hits; he hath"
3899) "    laid on twelve for nine, and it would come to immediate trial"
3900) "    if your lordship would vouchsafe the answer."
3901) "  Ham. How if I answer no?"
3902) "  Osr. I mean, my lord, the opposition of your person in trial."
3903) "  Ham. Sir, I will walk here in the hall. If it please his Majesty,"
3904) "    it is the breathing time of day with me. Let the foils be"
3905) "    brought, the gentleman willing, and the King hold his purpose,"
3906) "    I will win for him if I can; if not, I will gain nothing but my"
3907) "    shame and the odd hits."
3908) "  Osr. Shall I redeliver you e'en so?"
3909) "  Ham. To this effect, sir, after what flourish your nature will."
3910) "  Osr. I commend my duty to your lordship."
3911) "  Ham. Yours, yours. [Exit Osric.] He does well to commend it"
3912) "    himself; there are no tongues else for's turn."
3913) "  Hor. This lapwing runs away with the shell on his head.  "
3914) "  Ham. He did comply with his dug before he suck'd it. Thus has he,"
3915) "    and many more of the same bevy that I know the drossy age dotes"
3916) "    on, only got the tune of the time and outward habit of encounter-"
3917) "    a kind of yesty collection, which carries them through and"
3918) "    through the most fann'd and winnowed opinions; and do but blow"
3919) "    them to their trial-the bubbles are out,"
3920) "                            Enter a Lord."
3921) "  Lord. My lord, his Majesty commended him to you by young Osric, who"
3922) "    brings back to him, that you attend him in the hall. He sends to"
3923) "    know if your pleasure hold to play with Laertes, or that you will"
3924) "    take longer time."
3925) "  Ham. I am constant to my purposes; they follow the King's pleasure."
3926) "    If his fitness speaks, mine is ready; now or whensoever, provided"
3927) "    I be so able as now."
3928) "  Lord. The King and Queen and all are coming down."
3929) "  Ham. In happy time."
3930) "  Lord. The Queen desires you to use some gentle entertainment to"
3931) "    Laertes before you fall to play.  "
3932) "  Ham. She well instructs me."
3933) "                                                    [Exit Lord.]"
3934) "  Hor. You will lose this wager, my lord."
3935) "  Ham. I do not think so. Since he went into France I have been in"
3936) "    continual practice. I shall win at the odds. But thou wouldst not"
3937) "    think how ill all's here about my heart. But it is no matter."
3938) "  Hor. Nay, good my lord -"
3939) "  Ham. It is but foolery; but it is such a kind of gaingiving as"
3940) "    would perhaps trouble a woman."
3941) "  Hor. If your mind dislike anything, obey it. I will forestall their"
3942) "    repair hither and say you are not fit."
3943) "  Ham. Not a whit, we defy augury; there's a special providence in"
3944) "    the fall of a sparrow. If it be now, 'tis not to come', if it be"
3945) "    not to come, it will be now; if it be not now, yet it will come:"
3946) "    the readiness is all. Since no man knows aught of what he leaves,"
3947) "    what is't to leave betimes? Let be."
3948) "    Enter King, Queen, Laertes, Osric, and Lords, with other"
3949) "              Attendants with foils and gauntlets."
3950) "               A table and flagons of wine on it.  "
3951) "  King. Come, Hamlet, come, and take this hand from me."
3952) "                    [The King puts Laertes' hand into Hamlet's.]"
3953) "  Ham. Give me your pardon, sir. I have done you wrong;"
3954) "    But pardon't, as you are a gentleman."
3955) "    This presence knows,"
3956) "    And you must needs have heard, how I am punish'd"
3957) "    With sore distraction. What I have done"
3958) "    That might your nature, honour, and exception"
3959) "    Roughly awake, I here proclaim was madness."
3960) "    Was't Hamlet wrong'd Laertes? Never Hamlet."
3961) "    If Hamlet from himself be taken away,"
3962) "    And when he's not himself does wrong Laertes,"
3963) "    Then Hamlet does it not, Hamlet denies it."
3964) "    Who does it, then? His madness. If't be so,"
3965) "    Hamlet is of the faction that is wrong'd;"
3966) "    His madness is poor Hamlet's enemy."
3967) "    Sir, in this audience,"
3968) "    Let my disclaiming from a purpos'd evil"
3969) "    Free me so far in your most generous thoughts  "
3970) "    That I have shot my arrow o'er the house"
3971) "    And hurt my brother."
3972) "  Laer. I am satisfied in nature,"
3973) "    Whose motive in this case should stir me most"
3974) "    To my revenge. But in my terms of honour"
3975) "    I stand aloof, and will no reconcilement"
3976) "    Till by some elder masters of known honour"
3977) "    I have a voice and precedent of peace"
3978) "    To keep my name ungor'd. But till that time"
3979) "    I do receive your offer'd love like love,"
3980) "    And will not wrong it."
3981) "  Ham. I embrace it freely,"
3982) "    And will this brother's wager frankly play."
3983) "    Give us the foils. Come on."
3984) "  Laer. Come, one for me."
3985) "  Ham. I'll be your foil, Laertes. In mine ignorance"
3986) "    Your skill shall, like a star i' th' darkest night,"
3987) "    Stick fiery off indeed."
3988) "  Laer. You mock me, sir."
3989) "  Ham. No, by this bad.  "
3990) "  King. Give them the foils, young Osric. Cousin Hamlet,"
3991) "    You know the wager?"
3992) "  Ham. Very well, my lord."
3993) "    Your Grace has laid the odds o' th' weaker side."
3994) "  King. I do not fear it, I have seen you both;"
3995) "    But since he is better'd, we have therefore odds."
3996) "  Laer. This is too heavy; let me see another."
3997) "  Ham. This likes me well. These foils have all a length?"
3998) "                                                Prepare to play."
3999) "  Osr. Ay, my good lord."
4000) "  King. Set me the stoups of wine upon that table."
4001) "    If Hamlet give the first or second hit,"
4002) "    Or quit in answer of the third exchange,"
4003) "    Let all the battlements their ordnance fire;"
4004) "    The King shall drink to Hamlet's better breath,"
4005) "    And in the cup an union shall he throw"
4006) "    Richer than that which four successive kings"
4007) "    In Denmark's crown have worn. Give me the cups;"
4008) "    And let the kettle to the trumpet speak,"
4009) "    The trumpet to the cannoneer without,  "
4010) "    The cannons to the heavens, the heaven to earth,"
4011) "    'Now the King drinks to Hamlet.' Come, begin."
4012) "    And you the judges, bear a wary eye."
4013) "  Ham. Come on, sir."
4014) "  Laer. Come, my lord.                                They play."
4015) "  Ham. One."
4016) "  Laer. No."
4017) "  Ham. Judgment!"
4018) "  Osr. A hit, a very palpable hit."
4019) "  Laer. Well, again!"
4020) "  King. Stay, give me drink. Hamlet, this pearl is thine;"
4021) "    Here's to thy health."
4022) "               [Drum; trumpets sound; a piece goes off [within]."
4023) "    Give him the cup."
4024) "  Ham. I'll play this bout first; set it by awhile."
4025) "    Come. (They play.) Another hit. What say you?"
4026) "  Laer. A touch, a touch; I do confess't."
4027) "  King. Our son shall win."
4028) "  Queen. He's fat, and scant of breath."
4029) "    Here, Hamlet, take my napkin, rub thy brows.  "
4030) "    The Queen carouses to thy fortune, Hamlet."
4031) "  Ham. Good madam!"
4032) "  King. Gertrude, do not drink."
4033) "  Queen. I will, my lord; I pray you pardon me.          Drinks."
4034) "  King. [aside] It is the poison'd cup; it is too late."
4035) "  Ham. I dare not drink yet, madam; by-and-by."
4036) "  Queen. Come, let me wipe thy face."
4037) "  Laer. My lord, I'll hit him now."
4038) "  King. I do not think't."
4039) "  Laer. [aside] And yet it is almost against my conscience."
4040) "  Ham. Come for the third, Laertes! You but dally."
4041) "    pray You Pass with your best violence;"
4042) "    I am afeard You make a wanton of me."
4043) "  Laer. Say you so? Come on.                               Play."
4044) "  Osr. Nothing neither way."
4045) "  Laer. Have at you now!"
4046) "                [Laertes wounds Hamlet; then] in scuffling, they"
4047) "                    change rapiers, [and Hamlet wounds Laertes]."
4048) "  King. Part them! They are incens'd."
4049) "  Ham. Nay come! again!                         The Queen falls.  "
4050) "  Osr. Look to the Queen there, ho!"
4051) "  Hor. They bleed on both sides. How is it, my lord?"
4052) "  Osr. How is't, Laertes?"
4053) "  Laer. Why, as a woodcock to mine own springe, Osric."
4054) "    I am justly kill'd with mine own treachery."
4055) "  Ham. How does the Queen?"
4056) "  King. She sounds to see them bleed."
4057) "  Queen. No, no! the drink, the drink! O my dear Hamlet!"
4058) "    The drink, the drink! I am poison'd.                 [Dies.]"
4059) "  Ham. O villany! Ho! let the door be lock'd."
4060) "    Treachery! Seek it out."
4061) "                                                [Laertes falls.]"
4062) "  Laer. It is here, Hamlet. Hamlet, thou art slain;"
4063) "    No medicine in the world can do thee good."
4064) "    In thee there is not half an hour of life."
4065) "    The treacherous instrument is in thy hand,"
4066) "    Unbated and envenom'd. The foul practice"
4067) "    Hath turn'd itself on me. Lo, here I lie,"
4068) "    Never to rise again. Thy mother's poison'd."
4069) "    I can no more. The King, the King's to blame.  "
4070) "  Ham. The point envenom'd too?"
4071) "    Then, venom, to thy work.                    Hurts the King."
4072) "  All. Treason! treason!"
4073) "  King. O, yet defend me, friends! I am but hurt."
4074) "  Ham. Here, thou incestuous, murd'rous, damned Dane,"
4075) "    Drink off this potion! Is thy union here?"
4076) "    Follow my mother.                                 King dies."
4077) "  Laer. He is justly serv'd."
4078) "    It is a poison temper'd by himself."
4079) "    Exchange forgiveness with me, noble Hamlet."
4080) "    Mine and my father's death come not upon thee,"
4081) "    Nor thine on me!                                       Dies."
4082) "  Ham. Heaven make thee free of it! I follow thee."
4083) "    I am dead, Horatio. Wretched queen, adieu!"
4084) "    You that look pale and tremble at this chance,"
4085) "    That are but mutes or audience to this act,"
4086) "    Had I but time (as this fell sergeant, Death,"
4087) "    Is strict in his arrest) O, I could tell you-"
4088) "    But let it be. Horatio, I am dead;"
4089) "    Thou liv'st; report me and my cause aright  "
4090) "    To the unsatisfied."
4091) "  Hor. Never believe it."
4092) "    I am more an antique Roman than a Dane."
4093) "    Here's yet some liquor left."
4094) "  Ham. As th'art a man,"
4095) "    Give me the cup. Let go! By heaven, I'll ha't."
4096) "    O good Horatio, what a wounded name"
4097) "    (Things standing thus unknown) shall live behind me!"
4098) "    If thou didst ever hold me in thy heart,"
4099) "    Absent thee from felicity awhile,"
4100) "    And in this harsh world draw thy breath in pain,"
4101) "    To tell my story.         [March afar off, and shot within.]"
4102) "    What warlike noise is this?"
4103) "  Osr. Young Fortinbras, with conquest come from Poland,"
4104) "    To the ambassadors of England gives"
4105) "    This warlike volley."
4106) "  Ham. O, I die, Horatio!"
4107) "    The potent poison quite o'ercrows my spirit."
4108) "    I cannot live to hear the news from England,"
4109) "    But I do prophesy th' election lights  "
4110) "    On Fortinbras. He has my dying voice."
4111) "    So tell him, with th' occurrents, more and less,"
4112) "    Which have solicited- the rest is silence.             Dies."
4113) "  Hor. Now cracks a noble heart. Good night, sweet prince,"
4114) "    And flights of angels sing thee to thy rest!"
4115) "                                                 [March within.]"
4116) "    Why does the drum come hither?"
4117) "    Enter Fortinbras and English Ambassadors, with Drum,"
4118) "                  Colours, and Attendants."
4119) "  Fort. Where is this sight?"
4120) "  Hor. What is it you will see?"
4121) "    If aught of woe or wonder, cease your search."
4122) "  Fort. This quarry cries on havoc. O proud Death,"
4123) "    What feast is toward in thine eternal cell"
4124) "    That thou so many princes at a shot"
4125) "    So bloodily hast struck."
4126) "  Ambassador. The sight is dismal;"
4127) "    And our affairs from England come too late.  "
4128) "    The ears are senseless that should give us bearing"
4129) "    To tell him his commandment is fulfill'd"
4130) "    That Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead."
4131) "    Where should We have our thanks?"
4132) "  Hor. Not from his mouth,"
4133) "    Had it th' ability of life to thank you."
4134) "    He never gave commandment for their death."
4135) "    But since, so jump upon this bloody question,"
4136) "    You from the Polack wars, and you from England,"
4137) "    Are here arriv'd, give order that these bodies"
4138) "    High on a stage be placed to the view;"
4139) "    And let me speak to the yet unknowing world"
4140) "    How these things came about. So shall You hear"
4141) "    Of carnal, bloody and unnatural acts;"
4142) "    Of accidental judgments, casual slaughters;"
4143) "    Of deaths put on by cunning and forc'd cause;"
4144) "    And, in this upshot, purposes mistook"
4145) "    Fall'n on th' inventors' heads. All this can I"
4146) "    Truly deliver."
4147) "  Fort. Let us haste to hear it,  "
4148) "    And call the noblest to the audience."
4149) "    For me, with sorrow I embrace my fortune."
4150) "    I have some rights of memory in this kingdom"
4151) "    Which now, to claim my vantage doth invite me."
4152) "  Hor. Of that I shall have also cause to speak,"
4153) "    And from his mouth whose voice will draw on more."
4154) "    But let this same be presently perform'd,"
4155) "    Even while men's minds are wild, lest more mischance"
4156) "    On plots and errors happen."
4157) "  Fort. Let four captains"
4158) "    Bear Hamlet like a soldier to the stage;"
4159) "    For he was likely, had he been put on,"
4160) "    To have prov'd most royally; and for his passage"
4161) "    The soldiers' music and the rites of war"
4162) "    Speak loudly for him."
4163) "    Take up the bodies. Such a sight as this"
4164) "    Becomes the field but here shows much amiss."
