283) And so am I reveng'd. That would be scann'd
284) And so, without more circumstance at all
285) And spur my dull revenge! What is a man
286) And stand a comma 'tween their amities
287) And still your fingers on your lips, I pray
288) And sure I am two men there are not living
289) And tediousness the limbs and outward flourishes

296) And that in way of caution- I must tell you
297) And that our drift look through our bad performance
298) And that shall lend a kind of easiness
299) And that your Grace hath screen'd and stood between
300) And that, I hope, will teach you to imagine
301) And the King's rouse the heaven shall bruit again
302) And then this 'should' is like a spendthrift sigh
303) And then, they say, no spirit dare stir abroad
304) And there I see such black and grained spots
305) And there assume some other, horrible form
306) And there did seem in him a kind of joy
307) And therefore I forbid my tears; but yet
308) And therefore must his choice be circumscrib'd

314) And thirty dozed moons with borrowed sheen
315) And thou must cure me. Till I know 'tis done
316) And thou shalt live in this fair world behind
317) And thrice his head thus waving up and down

327) And to those thorns that in her bosom lodge
328) And vanish'd from our sight

330) And waits upon the judgment; and what judgment
331) And wants not buzzers to infect his ear
332) And we beseech you, bend you to remain
333) And we cast away moan
334) And we did think it writ down in our duty
335) And we shall jointly labour with your soul
336) And what make you from Wittenberg, Horatio

358) And with such maimed rites? This doth betoken
359) And with th' encorporal air do hold discourse
360) And with them words of so sweet breath compos'd
361) And you are stay'd for. There- my blessing with thee
362) And you must needs have heard, how I am punish'd
363) And you the judges, bear a wary eye

1247) Ham. I am tame, sir; pronounce
1248) Ham. I am very glad to see you.- [To Bernardo] Good even, sir
1249) Ham. I beseech you remember
1250) Ham. I could interpret between you and your love, if I could see

1271) Ham. I will receive it, sir, with all diligence of spirit. Put your
1272) Ham. I will tell you why. So shall my anticipation prevent your
1273) Ham. I will watch to-night
1274) Ham. I would I had been there
1275) Ham. I would not hear your enemy say so
1276) Ham. I would you did, sir; yet, in faith, if you did, it would not
1277) Ham. I'll be with you straight. Go a little before

1291) Ham. Is this a prologue, or the posy of a ring
1292) Ham. Is't possible
1293) Ham. It is as easy as lying. Govern these ventages with your
1294) Ham. It is but foolery; but it is such a kind of gaingiving as
1295) Ham. It is not very strange; for my uncle is King of Denmark, and
1296) Ham. It shall to the barber's, with your beard.- Prithee say on
1297) Ham. It was a brute part of him to kill so capital a calf there. Be
1298) Ham. It waves me still

1302) Ham. Judgment

1304) Ham. Let her not walk i' th' sun. Conception is a blessing, but not
1305) Ham. Let me see. [Takes the skull.] Alas, poor Yorick! I knew him
1306) Ham. Let the doors be shut upon him, that he may play the fool
1307) Ham. Look here upon th's picture, and on this
1308) Ham. Madam, how like you this play
1309) Ham. Make you a wholesome answer; my wit's diseas'd. But, sir, such
1310) Ham. Marry, this is miching malhecho; it means mischief
1311) Ham. Methinks it is like a weasel
1312) Ham. Mother, you have my father much offended
1313) Ham. Murther
1314) Ham. My excellent good friends! How dost thou, Guildenstern? Ah
1315) Ham. My fate cries out
1316) Ham. My lord, I have news to tell you. When Roscius was an actor in
1317) Ham. My mother! Father and mother is man and wife; man and wife is
1318) Ham. Nay come! again!                         The Queen falls
1319) Ham. Nay, I know not
1320) Ham. Nay, I know not. Is it the King
1321) Ham. Nay, but swear't
1322) Ham. Nay, but to live
1323) Ham. Nay, do not think I flatter
1324) Ham. Nay, that follows not
1325) Ham. Never make known what you have seen to-night
1326) Ham. Never to speak of this that you have seen
1327) Ham. No such matter! I will not sort you with the rest of my
1328) Ham. No, believe me, 'tis very cold; the wind is northerly
1329) Ham. No, by the rood, not so
1330) Ham. No, by this bad
1331) Ham. No, faith, not a jot; but to follow him thither with modesty
1332) Ham. No, good mother. Here's metal more attractive
1333) Ham. No, no! They do but jest, poison in jest; no offence i' th'
1334) Ham. No, nor mine now. [To Polonius] My lord, you play'd once
1335) Ham. No, not I
1336) Ham. No, you will reveal it
1337) Ham. Nor did you nothing hear
1338) Ham. Nor the soles of her shoe
1339) Ham. Not a whit, we defy augury; there's a special providence in
1340) Ham. Not so, my lord. I am too much i' th' sun
1341) Ham. Not this, by no means, that I bid you do
1342) Ham. Not where he eats, but where he is eaten. A certain
1343) Ham. Nothing
1344) Ham. Nothing but to show you how a king may go a progress through
1345) Ham. Now might I do it pat, now he is praying
1346) Ham. Now, mother, what's the matter
1347) Ham. O God
1348) Ham. O God, I could be bounded in a nutshell and count myself a

1350) Ham. O Jephthah, judge of Israel, what a treasure hadst thou
1351) Ham. O all you host of heaven! O earth! What else
1352) Ham. O good Horatio, I'll take the ghost's word for a thousand
1353) Ham. O my prophetic soul
1354) Ham. O that this too too solid flesh would melt
1355) Ham. O villany! Ho! let the door be lock'd
1356) Ham. O wonderful son, that can so stonish a mother! But is there no
1357) Ham. O, I die, Horatio
1358) Ham. O, but she'll keep her word
1359) Ham. O, horrible! O, horrible! most horrible
1360) Ham. O, reform it altogether! And let those that play your clowns
1361) Ham. O, throw away the worser part of it
1362) Ham. Of him, sir
1363) Ham. Of nothing. Bring me to him. Hide fox, and all after
1364) Ham. On him, on him! Look you how pale he glares
1365) Ham. One

1375) Ham. Sir, I lack advancement
1376) Ham. Sir, I will walk here in the hall. If it please his Majesty
1377) Ham. Sir, a whole history
1378) Ham. Sir, his definement suffers no perdition in you; though, I
1379) Ham. Sir, in my heart there was a kind of fighting
1380) Ham. Sir, my good friend- I'll change that name with you
1381) Ham. Slanders, sir; for the satirical rogue says here that old men
1382) Ham. So be it
1383) Ham. So long? Nay then, let the devil wear black, for I'll have a
1384) Ham. So much for this, sir; now shall you see the other
1385) Ham. So you must take your husbands.- Begin, murtherer. Pox, leave
1386) Ham. Speak the speech, I pray you, as I pronounc'd it to you
1387) Ham. Speak. I am bound to hear
1388) Ham. Such an act
1389) Ham. That I can keep your counsel, and not mine own. Besides, to be
1390) Ham. That if you be honest and fair, your honesty should admit no
1391) Ham. That is Laertes
1392) Ham. That skull had a tongue in it, and could sing once. How the
1393) Ham. That you must teach me. But let me conjure you by the rights
1394) Ham. That's a fair thought to lie between maids' legs
1395) Ham. That's two of his weapons- but well
1396) Ham. The King doth wake to-night and takes his rouse
1397) Ham. The King my father
1398) Ham. The air bites shrewdly; it is very cold
1399) Ham. The body is with the King, but the King is not with the body
1400) Ham. The concernancy, sir? Why do we wrap the gentleman in our more
1401) Ham. The phrase would be more germane to the matter if we could
1402) Ham. The point envenom'd too
1403) Ham. Then I would you were so honest a man
1404) Ham. Then are our beggars bodies, and our monarchs and outstretch'd
1405) Ham. Then came each actor on his ass
1406) Ham. Then is doomsday near! But your news is not true. Let me
1407) Ham. Then saw you not his face
1408) Ham. Then will I come to my mother by-and-by.- They fool me to the
1409) Ham. Then you live about her waist, or in the middle of her
1410) Ham. There's another. Why may not that be the skull of a lawyer
1411) Ham. There's letters seal'd; and my two schoolfellows
1412) Ham. There's neer a villain dwelling in all Denmark
1413) Ham. These tedious old fools
1414) Ham. They are coming to the play. I must be idle
1415) Ham. They are sheep and calves which seek out assurance in that. I
1416) Ham. This
1417) Ham. This likes me well. These foils have all a length
1418) Ham. Thou dost lie in't, to be in't and say it is thine. 'Tis for
1419) Ham. Thou pray'st not well
1420) Ham. Thrift, thrift, Horatio! The funeral bak'd meats
1421) Ham. To be, or not to be- that is the question
1422) Ham. To this effect, sir, after what flourish your nature will
1423) Ham. To what base uses we may return, Horatio! Why may not
1424) Ham. Two thousand souls and twenty thousand ducats
1425) Ham. Up from my cabin
1426) Ham. Upon my sword
1427) Ham. Upon the talk of the poisoning
1428) Ham. Upon what ground
1429) Ham. Very like, very like. Stay'd it long
1430) Ham. Very well, my lord
1431) Ham. Very well. Follow that lord- and look you mock him not
1432) Ham. We shall know by this fellow. The players cannot keep counsel
1433) Ham. We shall obey, were she ten times our mother. Have you any
1434) Ham. We'll ha't to-morrow night. You could, for a need, study a

1896) King. A Norman
1897) King. A very riband in the cap of youth
1898) King. Alas, alas
1899) King. And can you by no drift of circumstance
1900) King. Arm you, I pray you, to th', speedy voyage
1901) King. As of a man faithful and honourable
1902) King. At supper? Where
1903) King. Ay, Hamlet
1904) King. Break not your sleeps for that. You must not think
1905) King. Bring him before us
1906) King. But how hath she
1907) King. But where is he
1908) King. Come, Hamlet, come, and take this hand from me
1909) King. Conceit upon her father
1910) King. Dead
1911) King. Do you think 'tis this
1912) King. Faith, I must leave thee, love, and shortly too
1913) King. Follow her close; give her good watch, I pray you
1914) King. Follow him at foot; tempt him with speed aboard
1915) King. From Hamlet? Who brought them
1916) King. Full thirty times hath Phoebus' cart gone round
1917) King. Gertrude, do not drink
1918) King. Give me some light! Away
1919) King. Give them the foils, young Osric. Cousin Hamlet
1920) King. Go seek him there. [To Attendants
1921) King. Good Laertes
1922) King. Hamlet, this deed, for thine especial safety
1923) King. Have you heard the argument? Is there no offence in't
1924) King. Have you your father's leave? What says Polonius
1925) King. He made confession of you
1926) King. How do you, pretty lady
1927) King. How fares our cousin Hamlet
1928) King. How is it that the clouds still hang on you
1929) King. How long hath she been thus
1930) King. How may we try it further
1931) King. I do believe you think what now you speak
1932) King. I do not fear it, I have seen you both
1933) King. I do not think't
1934) King. I have nothing with this answer, Hamlet. These words are not
1935) King. I have sent to seek him and to find the body
1936) King. I like him not, nor stands it safe with us
1937) King. I pray thee, good Horatio, wait upon him
1938) King. If it be so, Laertes
1939) King. It falls right
1940) King. It likes us well
1941) King. It shall be so
1942) King. Laertes, I must commune with your grief
1943) King. Laertes, was your father dear to you
1944) King. Laertes, you shall hear them
1945) King. Let him demand his fill
1946) King. Let's follow, Gertrude
1947) King. Let's further think of this
1948) King. Love? his affections do not that way tend
1949) King. No place indeed should murther sanctuarize
1950) King. Not that I know
1951) King. Not that I think you did not love your father
1952) King. Now must your conscience my acquittance seal
1953) King. Now, Hamlet, where's Polonius
1954) King. O Gertrude, come away
1955) King. O heavy deed
1956) King. O, for two special reasons
1957) King. O, he is mad, Laertes
1958) King. O, speak of that! That do I long to hear
1959) King. O, yet defend me, friends! I am but hurt
1960) King. Our son shall win
1961) King. Part them! They are incens'd
1962) King. Pluck thein asunder
1963) King. Pretty Ophelia
1964) King. Set me the stoups of wine upon that table
1965) King. She sounds to see them bleed
1966) King. So is it, if thou knew'st our purposes
1967) King. So you shall
1968) King. Stay, give me drink. Hamlet, this pearl is thine
1969) King. Sweet Gertrude, leave us too
1970) King. Take thy fair hour, Laertes. Time be thine
1971) King. Thanks, Rosencrantz and gentle Guildenstern
1972) King. Thanks, dear my lord
1973) King. The doors are broke
1974) King. The very same
1975) King. There's matter in these sighs. These profound heaves
1976) King. Thou still hast been the father of good news
1977) King. Though yet of Hamlet our dear brother's death
1978) King. Thy loving father, Hamlet
1979) King. Thyself do grace to them, and bring them in
1980) King. To thine own peace. If he be now return'd
1981) King. We doubt it nothing. Heartily farewell
1982) King. We will try it
1983) King. Welcome, dear Rosencrantz and Guildenstern
1984) King. Well, we shall sift him
1985) King. What do you call the play
1986) King. What dost thou mean by this
1987) King. What is the cause, Laertes
1988) King. What, Gertrude? How does Hamlet
1989) King. Where are my Switzers? Let them guard the door
1990) King. Where is Polonius
1991) King. Who shall stay you
1992) King. Why, 'tis a loving and a fair reply
1993) King. Why, now You speak
1994) King. Will you know them then
1995) King. With all my heart, and it doth much content me
1996) King. [aside] It is the poison'd cup; it is too late
1997) King. [aside] O, 'tis too true
1998) King. [rises] My words fly up, my thoughts remain below
1999) Laer. A Norman was't
2000) Laer. A document in madness! Thoughts and remembrance fitted
2001) Laer. A touch, a touch; I do confess't
2002) Laer. Alas, then she is drown'd
2003) Laer. And so have I a noble father lost

2011) Laer. For Hamlet, and the trifling of his favour
2012) Laer. Hadst thou thy wits, and didst persuade revenge
2013) Laer. Have at you now
2014) Laer. He is justly serv'd
2015) Laer. How came he dead? I'll not be juggled with
2016) Laer. How now? What noise is that
2017) Laer. I am lost in it, my lord. But let him come
2018) Laer. I am satisfied in nature
2019) Laer. I know him well. He is the broach indeed

2026) Laer. Lay her i' th' earth
2027) Laer. Let this be so
2028) Laer. Most humbly do I take my leave, my lord
2029) Laer. Must there no more be done

2042) Laer. Think it no more
2043) Laer. This is too heavy; let me see another

2055) Laer. Where is my father
2056) Laer. Where is this king?- Sirs, staid you all without
2057) Laer. Why ask you this
2058) Laer. Why, as a woodcock to mine own springe, Osric

4109) true diction of him, his semblable is his mirror, and who else
4110) tutor. Suit the action to the word, the word to the action; with
4111) twenty, forty, fifty, a hundred ducats apiece for his picture in
4112) uncurrent gold, be not crack'd within the ring.- Masters, you are
4113) unto him. He takes her up, and declines his head upon her
