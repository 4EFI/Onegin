1338) "Ham. Let her not walk i' th' sun. Conception is a blessing, but not"

1347) "Ham. Between who"
1348) "Pol. I mean, the matter that you read, my lord"
1349) "Ham. Slanders, sir; for the satirical rogue says here that old men"
1350) "have grey beards; that their faces are wrinkled; their eyes"
1351) "purging thick amber and plum-tree gum; and that they have a"
1352) "plentiful lack of wit, together with most weak hams. All which"
1353) "sir, though I most powerfully and potently believe, yet I hold it"
1354) "not honesty to have it thus set down; for you yourself, sir"
1355) "should be old as I am if, like a crab, you could go backward"
1356) "Pol. [aside] Though this be madness, yet there is a method in't"
1357) "Will You walk out of the air, my lord"
1358) "Ham. Into my grave"
1359) "Pol. Indeed, that is out o' th' air. [Aside] How pregnant sometimes"
1360) "his replies are! a happiness that often madness hits on, which"

1364) "my leave of you"
1365) "Ham. You cannot, sir, take from me anything that I will more"

1376) "Ham. My excellent good friends! How dost thou, Guildenstern? Ah"
1377) "Rosencrantz! Good lads, how do ye both"
1378) "Ros. As the indifferent children of the earth"
1379) "Guil. Happy in that we are not over-happy"
1380) "On Fortune's cap we are not the very button"
1381) "Ham. Nor the soles of her shoe"
1382) "Ros. Neither, my lord"
1383) "Ham. Then you live about her waist, or in the middle of her"
1384) "favours"
1385) "Guil. Faith, her privates we"
1386) "Ham. In the secret parts of Fortune? O! most true! she is a"
1387) "strumpet. What news"
1388) "Ros. None, my lord, but that the world's grown honest"
1389) "Ham. Then is doomsday near! But your news is not true. Let me"
1390) "question more in particular. What have you, my good friends"
1391) "deserved at the hands of Fortune that she sends you to prison"
1392) "hither"
1393) "Guil. Prison, my lord"
1394) "Ham. Denmark's a prison"
1395) "Ros. Then is the world one"
1396) "Ham. A goodly one; in which there are many confines, wards, and"
1397) "dungeons, Denmark being one o' th' worst"
1398) "Ros. We think not so, my lord"
1399) "Ham. Why, then 'tis none to you; for there is nothing either good"
1400) "or bad but thinking makes it so. To me it is a prison"
1401) "Ros. Why, then your ambition makes it one. 'Tis too narrow for your"
1402) "mind"
1403) "Ham. O God, I could be bounded in a nutshell and count myself a"
1404) "king of infinite space, were it not that I have bad dreams"
1405) "Guil. Which dreams indeed are ambition; for the very substance of"
1406) "the ambitious is merely the shadow of a dream"
1407) "Ham. A dream itself is but a shadow"
1408) "Ros. Truly, and I hold ambition of so airy and light a quality that"
1409) "it is but a shadow's shadow"
1410) "Ham. Then are our beggars bodies, and our monarchs and outstretch'd"
1411) "heroes the beggars' shadows. Shall we to th' court? for, by my"
1412) "fay, I cannot reason"
1413) "Both. We'll wait upon you"
1414) "Ham. No such matter! I will not sort you with the rest of my"
1415) "servants; for, to speak to you like an honest man, I am most"
1416) "dreadfully attended. But in the beaten way of friendship, what"
1417) "make you at Elsinore"
1418) "Ros. To visit you, my lord; no other occasion"
1419) "Ham. Beggar that I am, I am even poor in thanks; but I thank you"
1420) "and sure, dear friends, my thanks are too dear a halfpenny. Were"
1421) "you not sent for? Is it your own inclining? Is it a free"
1422) "visitation? Come, deal justly with me. Come, come! Nay, speak"
1423) "Guil. What should we say, my lord"
1424) "Ham. Why, anything- but to th' purpose. You were sent for; and"
1425) "there is a kind of confession in your looks, which your modesties"
1426) "have not craft enough to colour. I know the good King and Queen"
1427) "have sent for you"
1428) "Ros. To what end, my lord"
1429) "Ham. That you must teach me. But let me conjure you by the rights"
1430) "of our fellowship, by the consonancy of our youth, by the"
1431) "obligation of our ever-preserved love, and by what more dear a"
1432) "better proposer could charge you withal, be even and direct with"
1433) "me, whether you were sent for or no"
1434) "Ros. [aside to Guildenstern] What say you"
1435) "Ham. [aside] Nay then, I have an eye of you.- If you love me, hold"
1436) "not off"
1437) "Guil. My lord, we were sent for"
1438) "Ham. I will tell you why. So shall my anticipation prevent your"
1439) "discovery, and your secrecy to the King and Queen moult no"
1440) "feather. I have of late- but wherefore I know not- lost all my"
1441) "mirth, forgone all custom of exercises; and indeed, it goes so"
1442) "heavily with my disposition that this goodly frame, the earth"
1443) "seems to me a sterile promontory; this most excellent canopy, the"
1444) "air, look you, this brave o'erhanging firmament, this majestical"
1445) "roof fretted with golden fire- why, it appeareth no other thing"
1446) "to me than a foul and pestilent congregation of vapours. What a"
1447) "piece of work is a man! how noble in reason! how infinite in"
1448) "faculties! in form and moving how express and admirable! in"
1449) "action how like an angel! in apprehension how like a god! the"
1450) "beauty of the world, the paragon of animals! And yet to me what"
1451) "is this quintessence of dust? Man delights not me- no, nor woman"
1452) "neither, though by your smiling you seem to say so"
1453) "Ros. My lord, there was no such stuff in my thoughts"
1454) "Ham. Why did you laugh then, when I said 'Man delights not me"
1455) "Ros. To think, my lord, if you delight not in man, what lenten"
1456) "entertainment the players shall receive from you. We coted them"
1457) "on the way, and hither are they coming to offer you service"
1458) "Ham. He that plays the king shall be welcome- his Majesty shall"
1459) "have tribute of me; the adventurous knight shall use his foil and"
1460) "target; the lover shall not sigh gratis; the humorous man shall"
1461) "end his part in peace; the clown shall make those laugh whose"
1462) "lungs are tickle o' th' sere; and the lady shall say her mind"
1463) "freely, or the blank verse shall halt fort. What players are"
1464) "they"
1465) "Ros. Even those you were wont to take such delight in, the"
1466) "tragedians of the city"
1467) "Ham. How chances it they travel? Their residence, both in"
1468) "reputation and profit, was better both ways"
1469) "Ros. I think their inhibition comes by the means of the late"
1470) "innovation"
1471) "Ham. Do they hold the same estimation they did when I was in the"
1472) "city? Are they so follow'd"
1473) "Ros. No indeed are they not"
1474) "Ham. How comes it? Do they grow rusty"
1475) "Ros. Nay, their endeavour keeps in the wonted pace; but there is"
1476) "sir, an eyrie of children, little eyases, that cry out on the top"
1477) "of question and are most tyrannically clapp'd fort. These are now"
1478) "the fashion, and so berattle the common stages (so they call"
1479) "them) that many wearing rapiers are afraid of goosequills and"
1480) "dare scarce come thither"
1481) "Ham. What, are they children? Who maintains 'em? How are they"
1482) "escoted? Will they pursue the quality no longer than they can"
1483) "sing? Will they not say afterwards, if they should grow"
1484) "themselves to common players (as it is most like, if their means"
1485) "are no better), their writers do them wrong to make them exclaim"
1486) "against their own succession"
1487) "Ros. Faith, there has been much to do on both sides; and the nation"
1488) "holds it no sin to tarre them to controversy. There was, for a"
1489) "while, no money bid for argument unless the poet and the player"
1490) "went to cuffs in the question"
1491) "Ham. Is't possible"
1492) "Guil. O, there has been much throwing about of brains"
1493) "Ham. Do the boys carry it away"
1494) "Ros. Ay, that they do, my lord- Hercules and his load too"
1495) "Ham. It is not very strange; for my uncle is King of Denmark, and"
1496) "those that would make mows at him while my father lived give"
1497) "twenty, forty, fifty, a hundred ducats apiece for his picture in"
1498) "little. 'Sblood, there is something in this more than natural, if"
1499) "philosophy could find it out"
1500) "Flourish for the Players"
1501) "Guil. There are the players"
1502) "Ham. Gentlemen, you are welcome to Elsinore. Your hands, come! Th"
1503) "appurtenance of welcome is fashion and ceremony. Let me comply"
1504) "with you in this garb, lest my extent to the players (which I"
1505) "tell you must show fairly outwards) should more appear like"
1506) "entertainment than yours. You are welcome. But my uncle-father"
1507) "and aunt-mother are deceiv'd"
1508) "Guil. In what, my dear lord"
1509) "Ham. I am but mad north-north-west. When the wind is southerly I"
1510) "know a hawk from a handsaw"
1511) "Enter Polonius"
1512) "Pol. Well be with you, gentlemen"
1513) "Ham. Hark you, Guildenstern- and you too- at each ear a hearer"
1514) "That great baby you see there is not yet out of his swaddling"
1515) "clouts"
1516) "Ros. Happily he's the second time come to them; for they say an old"
1517) "man is twice a child"
1518) "Ham. I will prophesy he comes to tell me of the players. Mark it"
1519) "You say right, sir; a Monday morning; twas so indeed"
1520) "Pol. My lord, I have news to tell you"
1521) "Ham. My lord, I have news to tell you. When Roscius was an actor in"
1522) "Rome"
1523) "Pol. The actors are come hither, my lord"
1524) "Ham. Buzz, buzz"
1525) "Pol. Upon my honour"
1526) "Ham. Then came each actor on his ass"
1527) "Pol. The best actors in the world, either for tragedy, comedy"
1528) "history, pastoral, pastoral-comical, historical-pastoral"
1529) "tragical-historical, tragical-comical-historical-pastoral; scene"
1530) "individable, or poem unlimited. Seneca cannot be too heavy, nor"
1531) "Plautus too light. For the law of writ and the liberty, these are"
1532) "the only men"
1533) "Ham. O Jephthah, judge of Israel, what a treasure hadst thou"
1534) "Pol. What treasure had he, my lord"
1535) "Ham. Why"
1536) "One fair daughter, and no more"
1537) "The which he loved passing well"
1538) "Pol. [aside] Still on my daughter"
1539) "Ham. Am I not i' th' right, old Jephthah"
1540) "Pol. If you call me Jephthah, my lord, I have a daughter that I"
1541) "love passing well"
1542) "Ham. Nay, that follows not"
1543) "Pol. What follows then, my lord"
1544) "Ham. Why"
1545) "As by lot, God wot"
1546) "and then, you know"
1547) "It came to pass, as most like it was"
1548) "The first row of the pious chanson will show you more; for look"
1549) "where my abridgment comes"
1550) "Enter four or five Players"
1551) "You are welcome, masters; welcome, all.- I am glad to see thee"
1552) "well.- Welcome, good friends.- O, my old friend? Why, thy face is"

1554) "Denmark?- What, my young lady and mistress? By'r Lady, your"
1555) "ladyship is nearer to heaven than when I saw you last by the"
1556) "altitude of a chopine. Pray God your voice, like a piece of"
1557) "uncurrent gold, be not crack'd within the ring.- Masters, you are"
1558) "all welcome. We'll e'en to't like French falconers, fly at"
1559) "anything we see. We'll have a speech straight. Come, give us a"
1560) "taste of your quality. Come, a passionate speech"
1561) "1. Play. What speech, my good lord"
1562) "Ham. I heard thee speak me a speech once, but it was never acted"
1563) "or if it was, not above once; for the play, I remember, pleas'd"
1564) "not the million, 'twas caviary to the general; but it was (as I"
1565) "receiv'd it, and others, whose judgments in such matters cried in"
1566) "the top of mine) an excellent play, well digested in the scenes"
1567) "set down with as much modesty as cunning. I remember one said"
1568) "there were no sallets in the lines to make the matter savoury"
1569) "nor no matter in the phrase that might indict the author of"
1570) "affectation; but call'd it an honest method, as wholesome as"
1571) "sweet, and by very much more handsome than fine. One speech in't"
1572) "I chiefly lov'd. 'Twas AEneas' tale to Dido, and thereabout of it"
1573) "especially where he speaks of Priam's slaughter. If it live in"
1574) "your memory, begin at this line- let me see, let me see"
1575) "The rugged Pyrrhus, like th' Hyrcanian beast"
1576) "Tis not so; it begins with Pyrrhus"

1584) "Bak'd and impasted with the parching streets"

1601) "Stoops to his base, and with a hideous crash"
1602) "Takes prisoner Pyrrhus' ear. For lo! his sword"
1603) "Which was declining on the milky head"
1604) "Of reverend Priam, seem'd i' th' air to stick"
1605) "So, as a painted tyrant, Pyrrhus stood"
1606) "And, like a neutral to his will and matter"
1607) "Did nothing"

1609) "A silence in the heavens, the rack stand still"
1610) "The bold winds speechless, and the orb below"
1611) "As hush as death- anon the dreadful thunder"

1959) "grieve; the censure of the which one must in your allowance"
1960) "o'erweigh a whole theatre of others. O, there be players that I"

2758) "Ros. Take you me for a sponge, my lord"
2759) "Ham. Ay, sir; that soaks up the King's countenance, his rewards"

2801) "convocation of politic worms are e'en at him. Your worm is your"
2802) "only emperor for diet. We fat all creatures else to fat us, and"
2803) "we fat ourselves for maggots. Your fat king and your lean beggar"
2804) "is but variable service- two dishes, but to one table. That's the"
2805) "end"
2806) "King. Alas, alas"
2807) "Ham. A man may fish with the worm that hath eat of a king, and eat"

3449) "Clown. Why, there thou say'st! And the more pity that great folk"
3450) "should have count'nance in this world to drown or hang themselves"
3451) "more than their even-Christen. Come, my spade! There is no"

3474) "Clown. To't"
3475) "Other. Mass, I cannot tell"
3476) "Enter Hamlet and Horatio afar off"
3477) "Clown. Cudgel thy brains no more about it, for your dull ass will"
3478) "not mend his pace with beating; and when you are ask'd this"
3479) "question next, say 'a grave-maker.' The houses he makes lasts"

3496) "And hath shipped me intil the land"
3497) "As if I had never been such"
3498) "Throws up a skull"
3499) "Ham. That skull had a tongue in it, and could sing once. How the"
3500) "knave jowls it to the ground,as if 'twere Cain's jawbone, that"
3501) "did the first murther! This might be the pate of a Politician"
3502) "which this ass now o'erreaches; one that would circumvent God"

3526) "great buyer of land, with his statutes, his recognizances, his"
3527) "fines, his double vouchers, his recoveries. Is this the fine of"
3528) "his fines, and the recovery of his recoveries, to have his fine"
3529) "pate full of fine dirt? Will his vouchers vouch him no more of"
3530) "his purchases, and double ones too, than the length and breadth"

3544) "For my part, I do not lie in't, yet it is mine"
3545) "Ham. Thou dost lie in't, to be in't and say it is thine. 'Tis for"

3818) "Into a tow'ring passion"
3819) "Hor. Peace! Who comes here"
3820) "Enter young Osric, a courtier"

3824) "Hor. [aside to Hamlet] No, my good lord"
3825) "Ham. [aside to Horatio] Thy state is the more gracious; for 'tis a"
3826) "vice to know him. He hath much land, and fertile. Let a beast be"
3827) "lord of beasts, and his crib shall stand at the king's mess. 'Tis"
3828) "a chough; but, as I say, spacious in the possession of dirt"
3829) "Osr. Sweet lord, if your lordship were at leisure, I should impart"
3830) "a thing to you from his Majesty"
3831) "Ham. I will receive it, sir, with all diligence of spirit. Put your"

3833) "Osr. I thank your lordship, it is very hot"
3834) "Ham. No, believe me, 'tis very cold; the wind is northerly"
3835) "Osr. It is indifferent cold, my lord, indeed"
3836) "Ham. But yet methinks it is very sultry and hot for my complexion"
3837) "Osr. Exceedingly, my lord; it is very sultry, as 'twere- I cannot"
3838) "tell how. But, my lord, his Majesty bade me signify to you that"
3839) "he has laid a great wager on your head. Sir, this is the matter"
3840) "Ham. I beseech you remember"
3841) "Hamlet moves him to put on his hat"
3842) "Osr. Nay, good my lord; for mine ease, in good faith. Sir, here is"
3843) "newly come to court Laertes; believe me, an absolute gentleman"
3844) "full of most excellent differences, of very soft society and"
3845) "great showing. Indeed, to speak feelingly of him, he is the card"
3846) "or calendar of gentry; for you shall find in him the continent of"
3847) "what part a gentleman would see"
3848) "Ham. Sir, his definement suffers no perdition in you; though, I"
3849) "know, to divide him inventorially would dozy th' arithmetic of"
3850) "memory, and yet but yaw neither in respect of his quick sail"
3851) "But, in the verity of extolment, I take him to be a soul of great"
3852) "article, and his infusion of such dearth and rareness as, to make"
3853) "true diction of him, his semblable is his mirror, and who else"
3854) "would trace him, his umbrage, nothing more"
3855) "Osr. Your lordship speaks most infallibly of him"
3856) "Ham. The concernancy, sir? Why do we wrap the gentleman in our more"
3857) "rawer breath"
3858) "Osr. Sir"
3859) "Hor [aside to Hamlet] Is't not possible to understand in another"
3860) "tongue? You will do't, sir, really"
3861) "Ham. What imports the nomination of this gentleman"
3862) "Osr. Of Laertes"
3863) "Hor. [aside] His purse is empty already. All's golden words are"
3864) "spent"
3865) "Ham. Of him, sir"
3866) "Osr. I know you are not ignorant"
3867) "Ham. I would you did, sir; yet, in faith, if you did, it would not"
3868) "much approve me. Well, sir"
3869) "Osr. You are not ignorant of what excellence Laertes is"
3870) "Ham. I dare not confess that, lest I should compare with him in"
3871) "excellence; but to know a man well were to know himself"
3872) "Osr. I mean, sir, for his weapon; but in the imputation laid on him"
3873) "by them, in his meed he's unfellowed"
3874) "Ham. What's his weapon"
3875) "Osr. Rapier and dagger"
3876) "Ham. That's two of his weapons- but well"
3877) "Osr. The King, sir, hath wager'd with him six Barbary horses"
3878) "against the which he has impon'd, as I take it, six French"
3879) "rapiers and poniards, with their assigns, as girdle, hangers, and"
3880) "so. Three of the carriages, in faith, are very dear to fancy"
3881) "very responsive to the hilts, most delicate carriages, and of"
3882) "very liberal conceit"
3883) "Ham. What call you the carriages"
3884) "Hor. [aside to Hamlet] I knew you must be edified by the margent"
3885) "ere you had done"
3886) "Osr. The carriages, sir, are the hangers"
3887) "Ham. The phrase would be more germane to the matter if we could"
3888) "carry cannon by our sides. I would it might be hangers till then"
3889) "But on! Six Barbary horses against six French swords, their"
3890) "assigns, and three liberal-conceited carriages: that's the French"
3891) "bet against the Danish. Why is this all impon'd, as you call it"
3892) "Osr. The King, sir, hath laid that, in a dozen passes between"
3893) "yourself and him, he shall not exceed you three hits; he hath"
3894) "laid on twelve for nine, and it would come to immediate trial"
3895) "if your lordship would vouchsafe the answer"
3896) "Ham. How if I answer no"
3897) "Osr. I mean, my lord, the opposition of your person in trial"
3898) "Ham. Sir, I will walk here in the hall. If it please his Majesty"
3899) "it is the breathing time of day with me. Let the foils be"
3900) "brought, the gentleman willing, and the King hold his purpose"
3901) "I will win for him if I can; if not, I will gain nothing but my"
3902) "shame and the odd hits"
3903) "Osr. Shall I redeliver you e'en so"
3904) "Ham. To this effect, sir, after what flourish your nature will"
3905) "Osr. I commend my duty to your lordship"
3906) "Ham. Yours, yours. [Exit Osric.] He does well to commend it"
3907) "himself; there are no tongues else for's turn"
3908) "Hor. This lapwing runs away with the shell on his head"
3909) "Ham. He did comply with his dug before he suck'd it. Thus has he"
3910) "and many more of the same bevy that I know the drossy age dotes"
3911) "on, only got the tune of the time and outward habit of encounter"
3912) "a kind of yesty collection, which carries them through and"
3913) "through the most fann'd and winnowed opinions; and do but blow"
3914) "them to their trial-the bubbles are out"
3915) "Enter a Lord"
3916) "Lord. My lord, his Majesty commended him to you by young Osric, who"
3917) "brings back to him, that you attend him in the hall. He sends to"
3918) "know if your pleasure hold to play with Laertes, or that you will"
3919) "take longer time"
3920) "Ham. I am constant to my purposes; they follow the King's pleasure"
3921) "If his fitness speaks, mine is ready; now or whensoever, provided"
3922) "I be so able as now"
3923) "Lord. The King and Queen and all are coming down"
3924) "Ham. In happy time"
3925) "Lord. The Queen desires you to use some gentle entertainment to"
3926) "Laertes before you fall to play"
3927) "Ham. She well instructs me"
3928) "Exit Lord"
3929) "Hor. You will lose this wager, my lord"
3930) "Ham. I do not think so. Since he went into France I have been in"
3931) "continual practice. I shall win at the odds. But thou wouldst not"
3932) "think how ill all's here about my heart. But it is no matter"
3933) "Hor. Nay, good my lord"
3934) "Ham. It is but foolery; but it is such a kind of gaingiving as"
3935) "would perhaps trouble a woman"
3936) "Hor. If your mind dislike anything, obey it. I will forestall their"
3937) "repair hither and say you are not fit"
3938) "Ham. Not a whit, we defy augury; there's a special providence in"
3939) "the fall of a sparrow. If it be now, 'tis not to come', if it be"
3940) "not to come, it will be now; if it be not now, yet it will come"
3941) "the readiness is all. Since no man knows aught of what he leaves"
3942) "what is't to leave betimes? Let be"
3943) "Enter King, Queen, Laertes, Osric, and Lords, with other"
3944) "Attendants with foils and gauntlets"
3945) "A table and flagons of wine on it"
3946) "King. Come, Hamlet, come, and take this hand from me"
3947) "The King puts Laertes' hand into Hamlet's"
3948) "Ham. Give me your pardon, sir. I have done you wrong"
3949) "But pardon't, as you are a gentleman"
3950) "This presence knows"
3951) "And you must needs have heard, how I am punish'd"
3952) "With sore distraction. What I have done"
3953) "That might your nature, honour, and exception"
3954) "Roughly awake, I here proclaim was madness"
3955) "Was't Hamlet wrong'd Laertes? Never Hamlet"
3956) "If Hamlet from himself be taken away"
3957) "And when he's not himself does wrong Laertes"
3958) "Then Hamlet does it not, Hamlet denies it"
3959) "Who does it, then? His madness. If't be so"
3960) "Hamlet is of the faction that is wrong'd"
3961) "His madness is poor Hamlet's enemy"
3962) "Sir, in this audience"
3963) "Let my disclaiming from a purpos'd evil"
3964) "Free me so far in your most generous thoughts"
3965) "That I have shot my arrow o'er the house"
3966) "And hurt my brother"
3967) "Laer. I am satisfied in nature"
3968) "Whose motive in this case should stir me most"
3969) "To my revenge. But in my terms of honour"
3970) "I stand aloof, and will no reconcilement"
3971) "Till by some elder masters of known honour"
3972) "I have a voice and precedent of peace"
3973) "To keep my name ungor'd. But till that time"
3974) "I do receive your offer'd love like love"
3975) "And will not wrong it"
3976) "Ham. I embrace it freely"
3977) "And will this brother's wager frankly play"
3978) "Give us the foils. Come on"
3979) "Laer. Come, one for me"
3980) "Ham. I'll be your foil, Laertes. In mine ignorance"
3981) "Your skill shall, like a star i' th' darkest night"
3982) "Stick fiery off indeed"
3983) "Laer. You mock me, sir"
3984) "Ham. No, by this bad"
3985) "King. Give them the foils, young Osric. Cousin Hamlet"
3986) "You know the wager"
3987) "Ham. Very well, my lord"
3988) "Your Grace has laid the odds o' th' weaker side"
3989) "King. I do not fear it, I have seen you both"
3990) "But since he is better'd, we have therefore odds"
3991) "Laer. This is too heavy; let me see another"
3992) "Ham. This likes me well. These foils have all a length"
3993) "Prepare to play"
3994) "Osr. Ay, my good lord"
3995) "King. Set me the stoups of wine upon that table"

3999) "The King shall drink to Hamlet's better breath"
4000) "And in the cup an union shall he throw"
4001) "Richer than that which four successive kings"
4002) "In Denmark's crown have worn. Give me the cups"
4003) "And let the kettle to the trumpet speak"
4004) "The trumpet to the cannoneer without"
4005) "The cannons to the heavens, the heaven to earth"
4006) "Now the King drinks to Hamlet.' Come, begin"
4007) "And you the judges, bear a wary eye"
4008) "Ham. Come on, sir"

4022) "King. Our son shall win"
4023) "Queen. He's fat, and scant of breath"
4024) "Here, Hamlet, take my napkin, rub thy brows"
4025) "The Queen carouses to thy fortune, Hamlet"
4026) "Ham. Good madam"
4027) "King. Gertrude, do not drink"
4028) "Queen. I will, my lord; I pray you pardon me.          Drinks"
4029) "King. [aside] It is the poison'd cup; it is too late"
4030) "Ham. I dare not drink yet, madam; by-and-by"
4031) "Queen. Come, let me wipe thy face"
4032) "Laer. My lord, I'll hit him now"
4033) "King. I do not think't"
4034) "Laer. [aside] And yet it is almost against my conscience"
4035) "Ham. Come for the third, Laertes! You but dally"
